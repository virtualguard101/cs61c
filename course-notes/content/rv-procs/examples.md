title: "Recursive Procedure Calls"
---


## Learning Outcomes

* Identify the prologue and epilogue of a procedure.
* Practice procedure calls, using recursive procedures as an example.
* Identify use cases for unconditional jump instructions and pseudoinstructions–in particular, know how to jump to procedures and return from procedures.

We recommend pulling up the [register convention section](#tab-calling-convention) of the [RISC-V Green Card](#sec-green-card). We also recommend referencing the [Fundamental Steps](#sec-rv-procedure-call-steps) ([revisited version](#sec-rv-procedure-call-steps-revisited)) of procedure calls.

## Recursive Example: `factorial`

Consider the below assembly implementation of `factorial`. We have omitted some lines for simplicity; see the full code at the end of this section.

(code-factorial-recursive)=
```{code} bash
:linenos:
main:
  li a0 3
  jal ra factorial
  …
factorial:
  addi sp sp -8
  sw ra 0(sp)
  sw s0 4(sp)
  mv s0 a0
  li t0 1
  bne s0 t0 recurse
  li a0 1
  j epilogue
recurse:
  addi a0 s0 -1
  jal ra factorial
  mul a0 s0 a0
epilogue:
  lw ra 0(sp)
  lw s0 4(sp)
  addi sp sp 8
  jr ra
```

:::{hint} Quick Check
Which lines correspond to the prologue and epilogue of the `factorial` procedure?
:::

:::{note} Show Answer
:class: dropdown

Start with the **epilogue**, which is labeled (the label `epilogue` on line 18  is tied to the `lw` instruction on line 19). Instructions on lines 19, 20, and 21 load values back into saved register `s0` and return address `ra`. and increment the stack pointer `sp`. Finally, line 22 `jr ra` returns to the caller function.

If the epilogue is "tear down," the **prologue** is "set up." We can see that instructions on lines 6, 7, and 8 decrement the stack pointer `sp` and store *callee-saved** registers `s0` and `ra` on the stack, which are used in the procedure itself.

:::{hint} Prologue

1. How large is the stack frame?
1. Which registers get saved to the stack?
:::

:::{note} Show Answer

1. 8B
1. Our own `ra`, because we (may) do a recursive function call. Our caller’s `s0`
:::

:::{hint} Recursive call
[Line 16](#code-factorial-recursive): As caller, why do we save `s0` before making the recursive call?
:::

:::{note} Show answer
:class: dropdown

Recursive factorial (for positive numbers) computes $\text{factorial}(n) = n! = n \cdot (n - 1)!$, for $n > 1$. $\text{factorial}(1) = 1! = 1.$

The [calling convention](#sec-rv-calling-convention) means saved registers like `s0` are preserved across the recursive call, so copy argument `a0` ($n$) to saved register `s0` so we can still use this value after the recursive call $(n-1)!$ completes.

:::

:::{hint} Temporary registers
[Lines 10-11](#code-factorial-recursive): Why do we use the temporary register `t0`?
:::

:::{note} Show answer
:class: dropdown

The branch instruction `bne` compare two registers. This instruction checks for our base case, which (as per Line 10) is `1`. We therefore load the immediate `1` into register `t0`.[^a0-s0] [^base-case-zero]

[^a0-s0]: Given the `mv s0 a0` instruction, we could have equivalently replaced the branch instruction `bne s0 t0 recurse` with `bne a0 t0 recurse`. The code likely uses the former to distinguish register naming conventions for register `a0`, which is both the first function argument and the return value. The register `s0` is designated as the value of $n$ in $\text{factorial}(n)$, and the register `a0` will soon become the return value (as per line 12).
[^base-case-zero]: Factorially is [mathematically defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) over all non-negative numbers, including $0!= 1$. The lecture code pedagogically chooses to ignore the zero case to show you `bne` with two non-zero register values.
:::


:::{hint} Epilogue
[Lines 18-22](#code-factorial-recursive) Do we restore registers first or pop stack frame?
:::

:::{note} Show Answer
:class: dropdown

First restore registers, whose values are stored on the stack. Then, pop the stack frame, right before returning to the caller.
:::

:::{hint} [Line 13](#code-factorial-recursive)
Why `j epilogue`? Why not `j ra`?
:::

:::{note} Show Answer
:class: dropdown

When returning, **the callee** is always responsible for preserving calling convention: restoring saved registers and deallocating the stack frame (e.g., restoring `sp`). While Lines 12 and 13 imply the callee has reached the base case, the base case must also complete the epilogue before returning to the caller.

The below code is for reference.

```bash
#### Recursive factorial
.globl factorial

.text
main:
    li a0 4
    jal ra, factorial

    addi a1, a0, 0
    addi a0, x0, 1
    ecall # Print Result

    addi a1, x0, '\n'
    addi a0, x0, 11
    ecall # Print newline

    addi a0, x0, 10
    ecall # Exit

# factorial takes one argument:
# a0 contains the number which we want to compute the factorial of
# The return value should be stored in a0

factorial:
    # Prologue
    addi sp sp -8
    sw ra 0(sp)
    sw s0 4(sp)
    
    # Body
    mv s0 a0
    li t0 1
    
    bne s0 t0 recurse
    
    # Base Case
    li a0 1
    j epilogue
    
recurse:
    addi a0 s0 -1
    jal ra factorial
    mul a0 s0 a0

epilogue:
    lw ra 0(sp)
    lw s0 4(sp)
    addi sp sp 8
    jr ra
```

:::{note} Expand for suggested Venus simulator settings
:class: dropdown

* In `main`:
  * `jal ra, factorial` (e.g., `factorial(4)` function call)
  * update `li a0 3` to simulate `factorial(3)`
* Set breakpoints in `factorial`:
  * the start of the procedure, i.e., `factorial` label
  * Base case
  * recursive call

Check register values `a0` and `s0`; suggest switching to `Decimal` view of register values

int foo(int i) {
  if (i == 0) return 0;
  int a = i + foo(i-1);
  return a;
}
int j = foo(3);
int k = foo(100);

  li a0 0       # int a = 0;
  j Epilogue    # Go to Epilogue

Next: 
  addi a0 s0 -1 # int j = i - 1;
  jal ra foo    # j = foo(j);
  add a0 s0 a0  # int a = i + j;
Epilogue:

  jr ra         # return a;
main:
  li a0 3       # int j = foo(3);
  jal ra foo    # call foo
  mv s0 a0      # mv rd rs1 sets rd = rs1
  li a0 100     # int k = foo(100);
  jal ra foo    # call foo
  mv s1 a0      # Saves return value in s1
  add a0 s0 s1  # int m = j+k;
