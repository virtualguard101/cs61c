## Dynamic memory allocation on the heap

Dynamic storage on the heap comes in handy when we must maintain persistent, resizable memory across function calls, such as when we write programs to build data structures through different function calls.

The closest analogy in Java is use of the Java keyword `new`, which dynamically allocates memory for an object. However, Java has a background garbage collector which frees dynamically allocated objects when they are unused. In C, we need to manually free space on the heap; we even need to manually resize space if we run out. These key differences lead to the biggest source of C memory leaks and bugs in more complex programs beyond the scope of this course.

Memory on the heap is managed with the help of standard C library functions in `stdlib.h`:

* `malloc`: **m**emory **alloc**ation, i.e., allocate a memory block on the heap
* `free`: free memory on the heap
* `realloc`: reallocate previously allocated memory blocks to a larger or smaller memory block on the heap.

Let's first describe heap operation at a high-level, then dive into the function signatures for each of these functions. This will inform potential pitfalls and details that we did not need to consider with stack memory.

## Heap operation

Let's first describe the heap in contrast to the stack. Dynamic memory (that is, storage in the heap) can be allocated (`malloc`-ed), resized (`realloc`-ed), and deallocated (`free`-d) during program runtime. We therefore do not necessarily need to know all sizes of memory blocks on the heap at compile-time; contrast this with the stack, where each local variable size must be determined first in order to determine the size of each stack frame.

The stack is a relatively small pool of memory, and memory blocks are allocated as stack frames, which are adjacent to one another. By contrast, the heap is typically **huge**–much larger than the stack—and memory blocks are not necessarily allocated in contiguous order.

The precise location of heap memory blocks is delegated to a built-in heap allocator implemented in the C standard library (read more in this chapter's [optional section](#sec-heap-allocator)). @fig-c-heap visualizes how a heap allocator might handle four memory requests.

1. Request R1: `malloc` 100 bytes of space. The heap allocator finds a block low in the heap.
1. Request R2: `malloc` 10 bytes of space. The heap allocator finds a block close to R1.
1. `free` the 100 bytes of space from request R1. The heap allocator marks the original block deallocated and available for future requests.
1. Request R3: `malloc` 50 bytes of space. The heap allocator may choose to allocate part of the block originally allocated for R1, or it may choose to put it somewhere entirely new. Both of these risk **fragmenting** the heap, preventing contiguous blocks for future requests.

`main` passes its own local variable `buf` into a function call `load_buf`.
:::

We do not expect you to know how a heap allocator decides where to allocate memory (see this chapter's [optional section](#sec-heap-allocator) if you are curious). Instead, know that we must be careful to assume anything about the  memory locations we get back from heap functions. We can only trust that a single request will return a contiguous block of memory; however, back-to-back heap memory requests can result in blocks that are quite far apart.

## C `stdlib` functions for heap management

### `void *malloc(size_t n)`

`malloc` is a function that takes in the number of bytes you want and returns a pointer to **uninitialized space**. In other words, the `n` bytes starting at that pointer initially contains garbage.

* **Parameter** `size_t n`: An unsigned integer type big enough to "count" memory bytes.
* **Return**: `void *` pointer, i.e., a pointer to generic space (read more in a [future section](#sec-generics)). A return value `NULL` indicates there is no more memory available on the heap.

Assuming size of objects can lead to misleading, unportable code, so we use `sizeof` in the below examples[^explicit-typecast].

:::{card} Allocate a struct
^^^
```{code} c
:linenos:
typedef struct { ... } treenode_t; 
treenode_t *tp = malloc(sizeof(treenode_t)); 
if (!tp) { ... }
```
:::

:::{card} Allocate an array of 20 `uint32_t`s:
^^^
```c
uint32_t *ptr = malloc(20*sizeof(uint32_t));
if (!ptr) { ... }
```
:::

[^explicit-typecast]: The **implicit typecast** shown in this section casts the return value of `malloc` from type `(void *)` to, say, `(treenode_t *)` and assumes it works. In **modern C, the implicit typecast is fine**. In pre-ANSI C, however, implicit pointer typecasting produces a warning, so **explicit** typecast syntax like `treenode_t *tp = (treenode_t *) malloc(sizeof(treenode_t)` is preferred. Finally, C++ is a different language entirely, and such implicit pointer typecasts will produce errors. These differences are important to keep in mind when you are porting C code between systems. Read more on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/605845/should-i-cast-the-result-of-malloc-in-c/33047365#33047365).

**Check for `NULL`**: We always want to check if `malloc` succeeds, so that we can safely exit instead of crashing. Contrast this failure mode with that of `main`, where returning a zero is success. Here, we know there is precisely one value that will never be a valid memory address: `NULL`, which upon access crashes your program.

**Typecast `malloc`'s return value**. Generally, we will **typecast** the returned generic pointer to a typed pointer. This means we will interpret the address returned by `malloc` as the location of a particular variable type. For example, if we are allocating heap space for a `uint32_t` array, typecasting to a `uint32_t *` pointer will facilitate pointer arithmetic, array access, and integer operations.

:::{tip} Quick Check
Consider the struct allocation code above. What is allocated on the heap, if any? What about on the stack, if any?
:::

:::{note} Show Answer
:class: dropdown

* Line 1: `typedef struct` does not allocate memory. It simply defines `treenode_t`.
* Line 2, RHS (right-hand side): `malloc(sizeof(treenode_t))` allocates `sizeof(treenode_t)` bytes of memory on the heap.
* Line 2, LHS (left-hand side): `treenode_t *tp` is a **local variable**. This declaration allocates at least `sizeof(tp *)` (i.e., the size of a pointer) onto the stack frame. Based on just the C code, we can't specify exactly how much data is allocated for the full stack frame, but it must be at least `sizeof(tp *)` unless the C compiler decides to optimize with hardware registers (more later).

### `void free(void *ptr)`

`free` is a function that takes in a pointer on the heap to free.

* **Parameter `void * ptr`**: A pointer containing an address originally returned by `malloc`/`realloc`.
* **Returns**: No return value.

Because the C heap does not do automatic garbage collection, as C programmers we must always `free` memory that we allocate on the heap. A good analogy draws from the film [_Godfather_ (1972)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/)[^godfather]:

> ... It's almost like going to the Godfather and asking for a favor.
> 
> You: [_clasps hands_] Godfather...I would like some some memory from you...
> 
> Godfather: [_strokes pet cat_] Some day–and that day may never come–I may call on you to do a favor for me. But until that day, I will give you this with `malloc` under the contract that you must free it when you are done...

:::{card} Allocate/deallocate heap memory
^^^
```c
uint32_t *ptr = malloc(20*sizeof(uint32_t));
...
free(ptr); // implicit typecast to (void *)
```
:::

If you do not `free` memory, you risk **memory leaks**–meaning that memory is allocated but never accessed on the heap, and you will eventually run out of memory. For long-running programs like servers, memory leak errors may lead to hard-to-debug crashes way, way into runtime.

If you do not `free` memory _properly_, your program will crash or behave very strangely later on, causing bugs that are VERY hard to figure out. Here's the corresponding segment of the Linux manual page (type in the command `man free`):

```
The free() function shall cause the space pointed to by ptr to be
deallocated; that is, made available for further allocation. If
ptr is a null pointer, no action shall occur. Otherwise, if the
argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a function
in POSIX.1‐2008 that allocates memory as if by malloc(), or if the
space has been deallocated by a call to free() or realloc(), the
behavior is undefined.
```

In other words, when you free memory: pass in the original address returned from `malloc`, and do not "double free". These arguments will produce undefined behavior. For example, passing in `ptr+1` would still technically point to somewhere in the original memory block, Above, the start of the `malloc`-ed heap block is the address stored in `ptr`. While passing in `ptr+1` would still technically point to somewhere within this memory block, depending on how `free` is implemented, `free(ptr+1)` may crash the program...or worse...

Why does the heap not check for these mistakes in runtime? In C, memory allocation is simply so performance-critical that there just isn't time to do this. The usual result is that you somehow corrupt the memory allocator's internal structure, and you won't find out until much later on in a totally unrelated part of your code. It's like not brushing your teeth regularly; you'll pay for it years later, and via symptoms not related to your teeth...

### `void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)`

`realloc` is a function that resizes a previously allocated block at ptr to a new size. In doing so, it _may_ need to copy all data to a new location.

* **Parameter `void *ptr`**: A pointer containing an address originally returned by `malloc`/`realloc`, OR the value `NULL`.
* **Parameter `size_t size`**: An unsigned integer type big enough to "count" memory bytes."
* **Return**: `void *` pointer, i.e., a pointer to generic space. A return value `NULL` indicates there is no more memory available on the heap.

From the Linux `man` page:

```
If ptr is a null pointer, realloc() shall be equivalent to
malloc() for the specified size.

If ptr does not match a pointer returned earlier by calloc(),
malloc(), or realloc() or if the space has previously been
deallocated by a call to free() or realloc(), the behavior is
undefined.

The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls
to realloc() is unspecified. The pointer returned if the
allocation succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be
assigned to a pointer to any type of object and then used to
access such an object in the space allocated (until the space is
explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such allocation shall yield
a pointer to an object disjoint from any other object. The pointer
returned shall point to the start (lowest byte address) of the
allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer
shall be returned.

...

RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, realloc() shall return a pointer to
the (possibly moved) allocated space. If size is 0, either:

*  A null pointer shall be returned and, if ptr is not a null
    pointer, errno shall be set to an implementation-defined
    value.

*  A pointer to the allocated space shall be returned, and the
    memory object pointed to by ptr shall be freed. The
    application shall ensure that the pointer is not used to
    access an object.
```

The below code discusses each of these points:

```{code} c
:linenos:
uint32_t *ip;

/* 1 */
ip = realloc(NULL, 10*sizeof(uint32_t));
if(!ip) { ... } // check for NULL
...

/* 2 */
ip = realloc(ip, 20*sizeof(uint32_t));
if(!ip) { ... } // check for NULL
...

/* 3 */
realloc(ip, 0);
```

:::{note} Explanation

As with `malloc`, we always want to check if the pointer returned from `realloc` is `NULL`, which would mean we've run out of memory. We do this for both Cases 1 and 2.

1. Line 4: Equivalent to `ip = malloc(10*sizeof(uint32_t));`
1. Line 9: Reallocate the original 10-`uint32_t`-sized block to a block that can store 20 `uint32_t`'s. In doing so, the updated block retains the contents of the first 10 elements, or whatever was in the original block. Because the address of the updated block may be different from the original block, update `ip` to the new address. The heap allocator will free the original block if relocation occurs, so the programmer is simply responsible for freeing the new block.
1. Line 14: Equivalent to `free(ip);` for some implementations of `free`.
:::

### `void *calloc(size_t nelem, size_t elsize);`

Many C programmers prefer to use `calloc` for allocating memory because, unlike `malloc`, it **initializes** all bits in the allocated block to zero. From the `man` page:

```
The calloc() function shall allocate unused space for an array of
nelem elements each of whose size in bytes is elsize.  The space
shall be initialized to all bits 0.
```

Like with `malloc` and `realloc`, any pointer returned by `calloc` should be always checked for `NULL` first.

## When Heap Memory Goes Bad

Working with the heap is tricky. Memory can be allocated / deallocated at any time! Some pitfalls:

* **Memory leak**: You forget to deallocate unused heap memory.
* **Use after free**: You free a memory block but still use that pointer somewhere later.
* **Double free**: You free the same memory twice.

:::{tip} Quick Check

How many memory management errors are in this code? 0, 1, 2, 3, or something else?

```{code}c
:linenos:
void free_mem_x() {
  int fnh[3];
  ...
  free(fnh); 
}

void free_mem_y() {
  int *fum = malloc(4*sizeof(int));
  free(fum+1);
  ...
  free(fum);
  ...
  free(fum);
  }
```

There are 3 errors:

* Line 4: `free()` on stack-allocated memory
* Line 9: `free()` on memory that isn’t the pointer from `malloc()`
* Line 13: Double `free()`
:::

### Memory leak / Failure to `free()`

The runtime does not check for the programmer’s failure to manage memory. Memory is so performance-critical that early C language designers effectively decided there isn’t time to check and manage memory in the background. The usual result of failing to manage your own memory is that you corrupt heap allocator’s internal structure, and you find out much later in a totally unrelated part of your code!

A **memory leak** is a failure to `free()` allocated memory.

* Initial symptoms. Nothing. Until you hit a critical point, memory leaks aren’t actually a problem.
* Later symptoms: Performance mysteriously falls off a cliff. Memory hierarchy behavior tends to be great just up until it isn’t, then it hits several cliffs.
* …and then your program is killed off! Because the operating system (OS) says "no" when you ask for more memory. We discuss this when we talk about virtual memory.

### Use after free

Recall that a **dangling reference** is when you keep using a pointer, even after it has been deallocated. In the below code, Line 

```{code} c
:linenos:
int *foo;
… 
foo = malloc(sizeof(int));
…
free(foo);
…
bar(foo); // !!!
```

Reads after the free may be corrupted! If something else takes over that memory, your program will probably read the wrong information. A dangling reference to already-freed memory can also corrupt other data, causing your program to crash _much_ later.

### Double Free

From the `man` pages (`man malloc`):

```
The  free() function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr,
which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc(),
calloc(),  or realloc().  Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has 
already been called before, undefined behavior occurs.  If 
ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.
```

The precise nature of the so-called "undefined behavior" depends on your program and your architecture but can include use-after-free (as before) or corrupting internal heap data (depending on how the heap allocator is implemented on your machine).

### Forgetting realloc() Can Move Data

From the `man` pages (`man malloc`):

```
The realloc() function returns a pointer to the newly allocated 
memory, which is suitably aligned for any built-in type, or 
NULL if the request failed.  The returned pointer may be the 
same as ptr if the allocation was not moved (e.g., there was 
room to expand the allocation in-place), or different from ptr 
if the allocation was moved to a new address.
```

**Example**: The following code calls `realloc` in Line 3 without reassigning the `nums` pointer. In this case, if `realloc` reassigns the block, then `nums` could now point to invalid memory; furthermore, we would also no longer have a pointer to the newly allocated block.

```{code} c
:linenos:
int *nums = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
int *g = nums;
realloc(nums, 20*sizeof(int));
```

The following code tries to fix the issue above by correctly reassigning `nums` in Line 3. However, because `g` still has the old value of `nums`, now `g` could point to invalid memory, since there is now no guarantee that `g == nums`.

```{code} c
:linenos:
int *nums = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
int *g = nums;
nums = realloc(nums, 20*sizeof(int));
```

## Valgrind

In general, to catch memory management errors, use tools like [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/). Valgrind slows down your program by an order of magnitude, but is invaluable for testing and debugging C code.extremely useful for testing. It adds many checks to catch most errors (but not all), including the most common cases described in this chapter: memory leaks, misusing `free()`, and writing over the ends of the arrays.
