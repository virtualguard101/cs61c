* Do a cursory comparison of C and Java.

## Hello World

(hello_world_c)=
:::{card}
C program: `hello_world.c`
^^^

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

:::

(hello_world_java)=
:::{card}
Java program: `hello.java`
^^^

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
```

### Highlights

* In C, we import libraries using `#include`. Here, we include `stdio` for `printf()`, which prints to stdout (here, the command-line).
* There is a `main` function.
  * C is **function-oriented**; unlike Java, this is not an object's method.
  * The return type of `main` is not `void`; it's an integer.
  * By convention, C programs return `0` on success. (The main rationale is it is easier to check equality to zero; we return to this soon)

### Run Demo

The below instructions are mostly for reference.  Refer to [this section](#compile-vs-interpret-sec) to understand details.

:::{note} Compile and run C
:class: dropdown

To run this program, use the command-line program, `gcc`, to compile the program. This creates a binary program with the default name `a.out` ([why the naming?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out#:~:text=out%20is%20a%20file%20format,'s%20PDP%2D7%20assembler.)). Then, run the binary program.

```bash
$ gcc hello_world.c
$ ./a.out
Hello World!
```

In practice, rename the binary to something more meaningful, like `hello_world`:

```bash
$ gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c
$ ./hello_world
Hello World!
```

You will also find it useful to generate debugging symbols for `gdb`, our debugger.

```bash
$ gcc -d -o hello_world hello_world.c
$ gdb hello_world
```

[^language-paradigm]:
    Java is an object-oriented language; C is mostly a functional language. In C, the core idea is the function, whereas in Java, it’s the class or abstract data type. While it is possible to write object-like code in C, if programs required objects then you should really be using C++.
  
[^compile-vs-interpret]:
    We've discussed this in detail in a [previous section](#compile-vs-interpret-sec).

[^dmm]:
    Java manages memory for you with garbage collection. In C, all the safety belts and padded rooms are gone; you do all the memory management yourself, and you can get in trouble very quickly. More next time.

[^member-selection]: Slightly different than Java because there are both structures and pointers to structures, more next time

[^conditional-evaluation]: `cond ? body_true : body_false`

## More Highlights

**1. Variable naming convention**: In C, use `snake_case`[^snake-case], NOT `camelCase` [^camelcase].

[^snake-case]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)

[^camelcase]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)

**2. Command-line arguments**: In our [`hello_world.c`](#hello_world_c) program, the `main` function can take in command-line arguments with two parameters:

* `argc` is an integer count of how many arguments you have. The executable itself counts as one argument. If you run something like `./hello_world my_file`, `argc` is `2`.
* `argv`: is a pointer to an array of the arguments themselves, as C strings. We discuss pointers, arrays, and strings in more detail next time. For now, if you run `./hello_world my_file`, the first[^zero-index] argument is the path of the program itself (`./hello_world`) and the second argument is the string `my_file`.

[^zero-index]: Like Python, C arrays and strings are zero-indexed.

:::{card}
**Command-line arguments**: What looks familiar about array syntax?
^^^

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf("Received %d args\n", argc);
  for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
    printf("arg %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

:::

**3. Curly braces**: The C language allows for some omission of curly braces for single-line statements—even for control structures like if-else and for. This is the same as in Java, but we didn't tell you. :-)

But just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Because subsequent lines of the control structure are considered outside of the body, omitting curly braces leads to many debugging errors[^curly-braces]:

[^curly-braces]: Stack Overflow: [Is it a bad practice to use an if-statement without curly braces?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2125066/is-it-a-bad-practice-to-use-an-if-statement-without-curly-braces)

:::{card}
**Omitting curly braces**: Which lines are printed?
^^^

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int x = 0;
    if (x == 0)
        printf("x is 0\n");
    if (x != 0) // careful!
        printf("x not 0 line 1\n");
        printf("x not 0 line 2\n");
    return 0;
}
```
