## Learning Outcomes

* Distinguish between a memory address and a value in memory.
* Get familiar with the paradigm of byte-addressable memory, i.e., that each byte in memory has an address, and each address refers to a byte location in memory.
* Understand that pointers are variables that store addresses.

## Memory Is Like a Byte-Addressable Array

For now, imagine all your memory as one really big, infinitely large array starting at zero, as shown in @fig-c-mem-byte-array.

The diagram shows variable x occupying four bytes with value 0x12345678 starting at address 0x100, a character array c holding b, y, e, and the null terminator starting at address 0x104, and pointer p storing address 0x00000100 starting at memory address 0x108."

One view of memory as a single huge array, where each byte has an address.

Think of this array as a very, very, very long street with lots of houses. Each cell is a house; the cell has someone living inside (e.g., a byte of data), and the cell also has a house address (e.g., a memory address). We worry about the range of addresses later; assume the street is infinitely long, but it starts from `0x0000000` (the all-zero address).

In this analogy, each cell of the array is **one byte wide**. Each byte, then, has an **address** associated with it, and the byte itself is has a **value**. For example, the byte at address `0x00000104` (i.e., "@" `0x104`) is the 8-bit pattern for the ASCII character `'b'`, or `0b01100010`.

Variable names can often refer to memory locations–specifically, blocks of memory. In @fig-c-mem-byte-array, the variable `x` is (say) an unsigned 32-bit integer. The variable `x` has value `0x12345678`. Its **address**, by convention, is the address of the _first_ byte of the memory block, also known as the **lowest** address of the block. In the diagram, the address of `x` is `0x00000100`.[^endiannness]

[^endianness]: Which byte of `x` is stored at the lowest address? Depends on your architecture. Read about endianness in [another section](#sec-endianness).

In this chapter, we will cover three very closely-related concepts that get us closer to understanding how memory works under the hood: **pointers**, **arrays**, and **C strings**. Each of these concepts come with their own benefits and pitfalls. Let's dive in!

## Pointers store addresses

You may have heard through the grapevine about pointers. You may be scared of pointers (or of the grapevine)! The key to understand pointers is to really internalize its definition:

> Pointer: A variable that contains the address of another variable.

In other words, it “points” to a memory location. This "pointing" analogy is somewhat confusing at first glance, so let's demystify.

In @fig-c-mem-byte-array-ptr, the pointer `p` "points to" `x`. But everything in C is bits under the hood, what this _actually_ means is that p is a variable that stores the address of `x`, or `0x00000100`. While `x` is (for example) an unsigned integer that occupies 32 bits, the value of `p` is the address of the **lowest** byte of `x`.

:alt: "The same byte-addressed memory layout is shown with a blue arrow from pointer p to variable x. This visual indicates that p stores x's starting address, 0x00000100."

The pointer `p` "points" to the location of `x` in memory. See the blue arrow.
:::

Because pointers themselves are also variables, they can also have addresses. In @fig-c-mem-byte-array-ptr, `p` is stored at address `0x00000108`.

Another phrasing you will hear is that you can "**follow**" pointers, meaning, we access the value that a pointer points to (a process we will formally call **dereferencing**). In this case, if we "follow" pointer `p`, we should get the value of `x`, which is `0x12345678`.

To do so, C requires that all pointers are **typed**. If we knew that `p` was a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer, then we know that following the pointer `p` should get the 4 bytes **starting at** `0x00000100`, not just the byte at `0x00000100` itself. We discuss this syntax in the next chapter.


:::{note} Summmarizing @fig-c-mem-byte-array-ptr

* `x` is a 4-byte-wide variable. We assume that `x` is an  32-bit unsigned integer. The variable `x` is located at address `0x100`, and its value is `0x12345678`.
* `p` is a variable, also 4-bytes wide. Because the diagram shows that `p` points to `x`, we can conclude that `p` is a pointer to an unsigned 32-bit integer. The pointer `p` is located at address `0x00000108`, and its value is `0x00000100` because it points to `x`.
* If we follow the pointer `p`, we get the 32-bit unsigned integer `0x12345678`.
