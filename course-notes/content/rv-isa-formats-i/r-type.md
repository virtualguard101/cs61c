::::

Like with [IEEE 754 floating point numbers](#fig-float), the 32 bits of a machine instruction are split into fields. Like floating point, each field has a **name** and occupies a given set of bit positions (and therefore has a fixed width). Unlike floating point, the field names and locations themselves depend on the **instruction type**.

As an example, an R-type instruction is shown in @fig-opcode-field. The field named `opcode` occupies the least-significant bits (bit positions 0 to 6); the `opcode` field is 7 bits wide. Also notice that the assembly instruction `opname rd rs1 rs2` shares _some_ nomenclature with instruction fields, _but not all_. For example, `rs1`, `rs2`, and `rd` are field names, but `opname` is not.

Field names and locations depend on the instruction format.
:::


:::{warning} Instruction formats specify which fields are where!
Different instruction formats may have different fields. Sometimes, different formats may specify _different places_ for the same field name!
:::

:::{hint} Use `opcode` to determine instruction format!

Fortunately, all RISC-V [instruction formats](#tab-rv32i-types) reserve the 7 lowest bits to the `opcode` field. Each instruction format is assigned a **distinct** set of opcode values.

When translating a machine instruction to assembly, the hardware first looks at the 7-bit `opcode` **first** to identify the instruction format type. **Once the format type is identified**, the hardware then knows how to treat the rest of the instruction.
:::

## R-Type: Fields

The R-Type instruction format is the first row of the [instruction format table](#tab-rv32i-types) of the [RISC-V green card](#sec-green-card). All **register-register arithmetic instructions use R-Type** (the "R" is for Register). We now use "arithmetic" to encompass arithmetic and bitwise operations: `add`, `xor`, `sll`, etc. 
We recommend you reference the [arithmetic instructions table](#tab-rv32i-arithmetic) as you explore the R-Type instruction format below.

@fig-r-type (@fig-opcode-field with less annotation) shows the R-Type format. Notice that all register-register arithmetic instructions have follow the same assembly instruction syntax `opname rd rs1 rs2`.

:::{figure} images/r-type.png
:label: fig-r-type
:width: 100%
:alt: "RISC-V R-type layout depicting assembly format: opname rd rs1 rs2 above a 32-bit bar with fields funct7 (bits 31–25), rs2 (bits 24–20), rs1 (bits 19–15), funct3 (bits 14–12), rd (bits 11–7), and opcode (bits 6–0), with rs1 and rs2 as source registers and rd as a destination register."

The R-Type Instruction Format.
:::

**Register operands**: The three R-Type fields named  `rs1`, `rs2`, `rd` map to their equivalent assembly instruction operands. Each field is a 5-bit unsigned integer ($0$ to $31$) corresponding to a register number (`x0-x31`). Register names (e.g., `a0`) are translated first into their register number (e.g., `x10`), then their bit pattern (e.g., `01010`).

* `rs1`: “Source” Register, first operand
* `rs2`: "Source" Register, second operand
* `rd`: "Destination" Register gets the result of the arithmetic computation.

**Other fields**: The assembly instruction operation `opname` is mapped across three fields: `

* `opcode`: All R-type instructions have the same 7-bit opcode: `0110011`.
* `funct3`, `funct7`: The arithmetic operation to perform. `funct3` field is 3 bits wide; `funct7` is 7 bits wide.

:::{warning} Why do we use 17 bits to specify the operation/opcode?
Across the entire base RV32I instruction set, there are certainly fewer instructions than the $2^32$ possible representable things in a 32-bit word, so some redundancy is unavoidable. Good esign demands good premises.

Different instruction formats **reuse the same bit positions for the same fields wherever possible**. Keeping the instruction formats as similar as possible reduces hardware complexity. The register fields `rs1`, `rs2`, and `rd` are therefore prioritized, and opcode fields like `funct3` and `funct7` occupy the remaining bits.

## Assembly Instruction $\rightarrow$ Machine Instruction

Consider @fig-rtype-add-example, which translates `add x18 x19 x10` to a machine instruction.

:width: 100%
:alt: "Encoding of add x18 x19 x10: funct7 is 0b0000000, rs2 is 0b01010 for register x10, rs1 is 0b10011 for register x19, funct3 is 0b000, rd is 0b10010 for register x18, and opcode is 0b0110011, with arrows tying add to funct7 and funct3 and register names to their five-bit fields."

The R-Type instruction `add x18 x19 x10`.

:::{note} Translate instructions from assembly to machine code

1. **Determine instruction format type**. Use the [RISC-V green card](#sec-green-card).

1. **Determine operation field codes**. Use the [RISC-V green card](#sec-green-card) to determine the `opcode` and (if applicable) `funct3` and `funct7`.

1. **Translate registers, immediates, etc.**

1. (if needed for human readability) **Convert to hexadecimal**.

:::

1. **Determine instruction format type**. `add` is R-type because it performs arithmetic on two register operands. We use the [arithmetic instructions table](#tab-rv32i-arithmetic) on the RISC-V green card.

1. **Determine operation field codes**.

    * `opcode`: `0110011` (for all R-Type instructions).
    * `funct3`: `000` for `add`
    * `funct7`: `0000000` for `add`

1. **Translate registers, immediates, etc.**

    * `rs1`: Register `x19`. Translate $19$ to 5-bit unsigned integer representation `10011`.
    * `rs2`: Register `x10`. Translate $10$ to 5-bit unsigned integer representation `01010`.
    * `rd`: Register `x18`. Translate $18$ to 5-bit unsigned integer representation `10010`.

1. (if needed) Convert to hexadecimal.

    * We leave this as an exercise to you!

## Machine Instruction $\rightarrow$ Assembly Instruction

Steps for translating machine code into assembly:

1. If needed, convert to binary. Then, find the opcode and use that to determine the instruction format type.
1. Split into fields according to instruction format type.
1. For R-Type, determine the assembly instruction `opname` with the `funct3`, `funct7` fields.
1. For R-Type, determine register operands and (if needed) register names.

The last two steps are **R-Type**-specific. In general, you should always do the first two steps, regardless of instruction format type. Then, perform type-specific conversions to reconstruct the original assembly instruction.

:::{tip} Quick Check

Translate this word into a RISC-V instruction:
`0x01B342B3`.

In binary: `0b0000 0001 1011 0011 0100 0010 1011 0011`.

* **A.** `slt  x5  x6 x27`
* **B.** `slt x27  x5  x6`
* **C.** `slt  x5 x27  x6`
* **D.** `xor s11  t0  t1`
* **E.** `xor  t0  t1 s11`
* **F.** `xor  t0 s11  t1`
* **G.** Something else
:::

:::{note} Show Answer
:class: dropdown

**E.** `xor  t0  t1 s11`

:::

Explanation:

1. We have already converted `0x01B342B3` to binary: `0b0000 0001 1011 0011 0100 0010 1011 0011`.

    **Then, find the opcode and use that to determine the instruction format type.** The `opcode` field is always the lowest 7 bits of the instruction, regardless of format. `0110011` is the opcode for R-Type instructions.

2. **Split into fields according to instruction format type.**. For translation, it is not particularly useful to visually space out nybbles, as above. In @fig-practice-hex-xor, the 32-bit pattern above is visually split into the six fields of the R-Type instruction format.

:::{figure} images/practice-hex-xor.png
:label: fig-practice-hex-xor
:width: 100%
:alt: "Worked R-type example: funct7 is 0b0000000, rs2 is 0b11011, rs1 is 0b00110, funct3 is 0b100, rd is 0b00101, and opcode is 0b0110011, corresponding to xor x5 x6 x27 once fields are translated."

Once an instruction's type is known, the instruction bits can be mapped to fields.
:::

3. **Determine the assembly instruction `opname`**. The `funct3` field is `100`; the `funct7` field is `0000000`. We look up these fields on our [green card](#tab-rv32i-arithmetic) and discover the instruction is `xor`.

4. **Determine registers**. Use the [register convention table](#tab-calling-convention) for register names.

    * `rd`: `10010` is $5$, so register `x5`, aka `t0`.
    * `rs1`: `00110` is $6$, so register `x6`, aka `t1`
    * `rs2`: `11011` is $27$, so register `x27`, aka `s11`.

Given the above, the instruction is **E.** `xor  t0  t1 s11`.

## Design Decisions for R-Type

Consider all 10 R-Type instructions shown in @tab-r-type, which is a reformatting of the rightmost columns of the [equivalent table](#tab-rv32i-arithmetic) on the RISC-V green card.

Analyze this table. What do you notice? What do you wonder? The below discussion questions practice the following:

1. Read and interpret instruction fields
1. Develop your design intuition for architecture.

R-Type: How many unique `opcode`’s?
:::

:::{note} Show Explanation
:class: dropdown
One `opcode` for all R-Types: `0110011`.
:::

:::{tip} Discussion Question 2
R-Type: How many unique `funct3`’s? unique `funct7`’s?
:::

:::{note} Show Explanation
:class: dropdown

* `funct3`: 8 unique, despite there being 10 instructions.
* `funct7`: 2 unique. The remaining two instructions vary in `funct7` fields.
:::

:::{tip} Discussion Question 3
Which instructions share `funct3` fields? What are their corresponding `funct7` fields?
:::

:::{note} Show Explanation
:class: dropdown

(sec-funct7-explanation)=
* `funct3` field `000`: `add` and `sub`. To differentiate, look at `funct7` field.
    * `sub` has a `1` in bit 30, whereas `add` does not.
* `funct3` field `101`: `srl`, `sra`.  To differentiate, look at `funct7` field.
    * `sra` has a `1` in bit 30, whereas `srl` does not.

:::

:::{tip} Discussion Question 4
For the instructions you found in the previous part, how _else_ are they similar? Why might this be useful?
:::

:::{note} Show Explanation

We have pre-expanded this box because it is so important.

* `add` and `sub` can share hardware. To execute `sub rd rs1 rs2` with an `add`, the hardware should negate register `rs2` value. Bit 30 is therefore a **flag**, or boolean indicator, that indicates when it is necessary to perform a two's complement **negation** of the bits of `rs2` before adding (for `sub`). If Bit 30 is off, just `add` like normal.
* `srl` and `sra` are both right-shifts and can share hardware. The difference is **sign-extension**. Bit 30 is therefore a flag that indicates when it is necessary to sign-extend and insert leading `1`'s (for `sra`). If Bit 30 is off, just zero-extend for `srl`.
