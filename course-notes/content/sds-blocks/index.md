Last time we saw how to represent and design **combinational logic blocks**. In this section we will study a few special logic blocks; data multiplexors, a adder/subtractor circuit, and an arithmetic/logic unit.

## The Mux

A data **multiplexor**, commonly called a **mux** or a **selector**, is a circuit that selects its output value from a set of input values. Below are two mux circuits.

Both of these muxes have two **data** inputs and one output. Additionally, each mux has a special **control signal** labeled s, for **select**. The s signal is also input, but it is used to control which of the two input values is directed to the output.

@fig-mux-2 shows a **1-bit wide**, **2-to-1** mux circuit:

* 2-to-1 because it takes two data inputs `a` and `b` and outputs one of them.
* It is 1-bit wide because all data signals (`a` and `b`) are 1-bit in width.
* Notice, however, that the `s` signal is a single bit wide. This is because it must choose between the 2 inputs.

@fig-mux-n shows an **n-bit wide**, **2-to-1** mux circuit:

* 2-to-1 because it takes two data inputs `A` and `B` and outputs one of them.
* It is 1-bit wide because all data signals (`A` and `B`) are 1-bit in width.
* The `s` signal is still a single bit wide because it must choose between the 2 inputs.

The function of, say, the [1-bit wide 2-to-1 mux](#fig-mux-2) can be described with two rules:

```{math}
\texttt{y} = 
\begin{cases}
\texttt{a} & \text{when } \texttt{s} = 0 \\
\texttt{b} & \text{when } \texttt{s} = 1 \\
\end{cases}
```

To remind us of which value of s corresponds to which input, within the mux symbol we commonly label each input with its corresponding s value.

:::{hint} Use muxes to select data!
A mux is used whenever a circuit must choose data from multiple sources.

An n-bit wide N-to-1 MUX has N data inputs, 1 control input, and 1 output. The control input S selects between the other N inputs.

Muxes find common use within the design of microprocessors, e.g., those that implement RISC-V.

## MUX: Implementation

In most applications, you will have access to a mux; you will not need to build your own from scratch. Nevertheless, it is good to remember that like all combinational logic blocks, the function of muxes can be described using a truth table and thereby implemented as a logic gate circuit.

### 1-bit wide, 2-to-1 MUX

How do we implement the mux in @fig-mux-2, discussed above?

This circuit can be expressed in Boolean algebra:

$$ y = \overline{s} a + s b $$

Expand the dropdown items below to show the gate circuit and derive the above expression.

::::{note} Show Boolean Algebra Explanation
:class: dropdown

To come up with the logic equation and the associated gate-level circuit diagram we can apply
the technique that we studied [last chapter](#sec-boolean-algebra). We write the sum-of-products canonical form and simplify through algebraic manipulation:

```{math}
\begin{aligned}
     c 
     &= \overline{s} a \overline{b} + \overline{s} a b + s \overline{a} b + sab && \text{Sum of Products} \\
     &= \overline{s} (a \overline{b} + ab) + s (\overline{a} b + ab) && \text{Distributive Property} \\
     &= \overline{s} (a (\overline{b} + b)) + s ((\overline{a} + a) b) && \text{Distributive Property} \\
     &= \overline{s} (a \cdot 1) + s (1 \cdot b) && \text{Inverse (OR)} \\
     &= \overline{s} a + sb && \text{Identity (AND)} \\
\end{aligned}
```

Intuitively this result makes sense; When the control input, `s`, is a `0`, the expression on the right-hand side of the expression reduces to `a`, and when it is a `1`, the expression reduces to `b`.

### 1-bit wide 4-to-1 mux

Often times we find the need to extend the number of data inputs of a multiplexor. For instance consider a 4-to-1 multiplexor in @fig-mux-4-bits:

:alt: "1-bit 4-to-1 mux symbol with inputs a through d, select bits s1 s0, and 1-bit output e."

@fig-mux-4-block shows how this larger mux can be formed by wiring together smaller MUXes.

:label: fig-mux-4-block
:width: 60%
:alt: "4-to-1 mux built from three 2-to-1 muxes. Initially, two 2-to-1 muxes are selected with select bit s0, and the outputs feed the third 2-to-1 mux that uses select bit s1 to get the final resulting output e."

This circuit design leverages the hierarchical nature of multiplexing. The first layer of muxes uses the $s_0$ input to narrow the four inputs down to two, then the second layer uses $s_1$ to choose the final output.

::::{note} Show Boolean Algebra Approach
:class: dropdown

```{math}
\texttt{e} = 
\begin{cases}
\texttt{a} & \text{when } \texttt{S} = 00 \\
\texttt{b} & \text{when } \texttt{S} = 01 \\
\texttt{c} & \text{when } \texttt{S} = 10 \\
\texttt{d} & \text{when } \texttt{S} = 11 \\
\end{cases}
```

An alternate approach could start by enumerating the truth-
table—in this case the function has 4 single bit data inputs and one 2-bit wide control input, for a total of 6 single bit inputs. The truth table would have 26, or 64 rows. Certainly, a feasible approach. If we were to do this, we would end up with the following logic equation:

$$e = \overline{s_1 s_0} a
     + \overline{s_1} s_0 b
     + s_1 \overline{s_0} c
     + s_1 s_0 d$$
