In the [previous chapter](#sec-intro-sds), we discussed a chip, which is composed of wires and transistors (among other things):

Surrounding the inner part of the chip—the core—is a set of connections to the outside world. Usually these connect through some wires in the plastic or ceramic package to the printed circuit board (PCB). In the case of most computers this PCB would be the motherboard. Some of these connections go to the main memory and the system bus. A fair number of the pins are used to connect to the power supply. The power supply takes the 110 Volt AC from the wall socket (provided by PG&E) and converts it to low voltage DC (usually in the range of around 1 to 5 volts, depending on the particular chip used). The DC voltage is measured relative to ground potential (GND). Power connections to the chip from the power supply are of two types; GND, and DC Voltage (labeled "Vdd").

The energy provided by the power supply drives the operation of the processor. The energy is used to move electric charge from place to place in the circuits and in the process is dissipated as heat. These days a processor my use on the order of 10 watts—like a not-so-bright light bulb.

(sec-clock)=
## The Clock

Another special connection to the chip is the **clock input signal**[^sds-handout]. The clock signal is generated on the motherboard and sent to the chip, where it is distributed throughout the processor on internal wires.

[^sds-handout]: These notes are adapted from Professor John Wawrzynek's notes: [SDS Handout](../resources/sds.pdf).

:::{tip} The clock signal is the **heartbeat of the system**.

It controls the **timing** of the flow of electric charge (and thus **information**) through out the processor and off-chip to the memory and system bus.
:::

If we had a very small probe we could examine the signal on the clock wires, by looking at the voltage level on the wire.
We would see a blur, because the clock signal is oscillating at a very high frequency (around **1 billion cycles/second or 1GHz**, these days). If we could record it for a brief instant and plot it out we would see something like @fig-clock-waveform.

:alt: "Ideal square-wave clock waveform: alternating low and high plateaus with period T and sharp rising and falling edges."

Waveform for a clock signal if recorded and plotted over time.
:::

:::{note} The **clock signal** is very regular.

This signal is a repeating "square wave". One clock cycle (tick) is the time from any place on the waveform to the same place on the next instance of the waveform.
:::

For CS 61C, we will almost always measure the clock period from the rising-edge of the signal to the next rising-edge. We will see later that the clock signal is a very important signal and is present in all synchronous digital systems.

:::{note} Why are they called *rising* and *falling* edges of the clock signal?
:class: dropdown

The idea of *rising* and *falling* edges comes from the idea of imagining that the signal might start at a low voltage and rise to the high voltage, stay there for half the period, and then fall to the low voltage, where it stays for another half period, etc.
:::

## Signals and Waveforms

Similarly to the clock signal, we can look at other signals in the circuit. For instance, suppose we found an adder circuit. How would we know it's an adder circuit? We could put a recording probe at its input and observe a waveform[^sds-handout] like @fig-adder-waveform.

[^sds-handout]: These notes are adapted from Professor John Wawrzynek's notes: [SDS Handout](../resources/sds.pdf).

:alt: "Top depicts a block representing adder circuit with many single bit inputs and many outputs. Bottom depicts a clock waveform, showing adder input bits holding stable levels between transitions and changing in relation to clock edges."

:::

If we had two probes, we could look at two signals simultaneously. Imagine that we probe the two least significant bits of one of the inputs to the adder. Based on the recorded waveforms, displayed above the clock signal in @fig-adder-waveform, we can make the following observations.

1. Most of the time, the signals are in one of two positions: **low voltage** or **high voltage**.

:::{note} Why?
:class: dropdown

By convention, low voltage is used to represent a binary `0` and high voltage is used to represent a binary `1`. At different points in time, the particular bit position of the input to the adder has a value of `0`, and at other times, has a value of `1`.
:::

2. When the signals are at the high or low voltage levels, they are sometimes not quite all the way to the voltage extremes.

:::{note} Why?
:class: dropdown

The transistor circuits that make up the adder and its subcircuits are robust against small errors in voltage. If the signal is *close* to high voltage, it is interpreted as a logic `1`, and similarly, if it is *close* to 0 volts, it is interpreted as a logic `0`. Therefore, errors (or deviations from ideal voltages) do not accumulate as signals move from circuit to circuit.

The circuits have the property that they take input signals that may not be ideal, in the sense of being exactly at the voltage extremes, and produce outputs precisely at the voltage extremes. This **restoration property** is a critical property of digital circuits!
:::

3. Changes in the signals seem to correspond to changes in the clock signal, but they don't always change every time the clock cycle changes.

:::{note} Why?
:class: dropdown

In synchronous systems, all changes follow clock edges. The clock signal is used throughout the system to control when signals may take on new values.
:::

### Signal Wires

Signal wires are often grouped together to transmit words of data, as shown in @fig-sig-wires. This drawing shows a collection of 4 wires used to transmit a 4-bit word. The waveforms show how the signals on the wires might change over time. Lower-case letters are used to label the individual wires and signals. The corresponding upper-case letter is used to label the collection of wires (sometimes referred to as a *bus*). Drawing a single waveform that represents all the signals on the bus is difficult because, at any instant, each wire could have a different value. If we need to show the timing of the changes of the signals on a bus, we can draw a waveform like @fig-sig-wires. Here, we draw the bus signal as simultaneously high and low voltage, and label each closed section with the value on the bus at that instant. In addition to the values on the bus, the timing of the changes is another important piece of information we can observe from waveforms like this.

## Circuit Delay: Propagation Delay

:::{tip} Propagation Delay

A measure of the delay from input to output, in general, is called the **propagation delay**. Propagation delay occurs in all circuits, including combinational logic circuits.

However, the propagation delay of a circuit, like the adder, is always less than the clock period. We discuss this more in a [later section].

## Summary: Synchronous Digital System

@fig-general-model-sds shows the general model for our synchronous systems:

:::{figure} images/general-model-sds.png
:label: fig-general-model-sds
:width: 100%
:alt: "Synchronous system sketch: combinational logic blocks interleaved with registers, optional feedback, and a clock distribution that connects only to register clock pins."

General model for SDS.
:::

* Our circuit is a collection of combinational logic blocks (CL blocks) separated by registers.
* Registers may be back-to-back; CL blocks may be back-to-back.
* Feedback is optional.
* Clock signal(s) connects only to clock input of registers. Combinational logic blocks are stateless and not clocked.
