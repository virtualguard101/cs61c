Finite State Machines (FSMs)[^state-handout] are a useful abstraction for many types of computing tasks. These show up in many areas of computer science and are often used in hardware design. As an example, for a hardware controlled cache in a processor design, a FSM would be used to control the set of actions associated with servicing loads and stores from the processor. It would go through a series of "states" as it responds to requests from the processor, as times needing to access main memory and put new data into the cache. We can imagine describing the cache behavior as an algorithm or program, and this algorithm would be implemented in hardware with a FSM!

[^state-handout]: These notes are adapted from Professor John Wawrzynek's notes: [State Handout](../resources/state.pdf).

## Finite State Machines
A FSM has a set of **inputs**, a set of **outputs**, and a finite collection of **states**. At any point in time, the machine is in one of the states. Each state can have one or more arcs that takes the machine from the current state to a new state when certain input values appear. Output values are associated with arcs, meaning that when a machine leaves a state, it can change its output value, depending on which new state it is transitioning to and which input value was seen. FSM states are given unique names and, by convention, arcs are labeled with their associated input and output values as seen in @fig-fsm.

:::{note} What is a "self-loop"?

Self-loops are FSM arcs that represent no change in state (see State 2 in @fig-fsm). These arcs indicate that a certain input, associated with that arc, did not change the machine's current state. However, these self-loop arcs can still be associated with a change in output value.

## Example: Three One's
Given combinational logic circuits and registers, FSMs can be implemented in hardware. As an example, let's consider a small circuit that is used to detect the occurrence of three 1's in a row in an input sequence of bits.

### Waveform Diagram

In this circuit, we assume single bit values are applied one per cycle to the input of the FSM, as shown in the timing diagram in @fig-three1s-timing. On the cycle when the third 1 of a string of three 1's appears at the input of the FSM, the machine's output changes to a 1 for one cycle. After, the output returns to 0 until the FSM detects another string of three 1's.

### Finite State Machine
To design the FSM for this example circuit, we start by drawing the state diagram. 

* The `S0` state is the state the machine is in when it begins counting 1's. This occurs both at the beginning of the sequence, and every time the machine resets and begins looking for a sequence of three 1's again.
* The `S1` state is the state the machine is in when it has seen one `1`.
* The `S2` state is the state the machine is in when it has seen two sequential `1` bits.

In state `S0`, if the machine sees a `1`, it transitions to state `S1` with `0` output. If the machine sees a `0`, there is a self-loop and it remains in `S0` with `0` output.

In state `S1`, if the machine sees a `1`, the output still remains `0` and the machine transitions to state `S2`. If the machine sees a `0`, it resets, returning to state `S0` with `0` output.

In state `S2`, if the machine sees another `1`, then the output is changed to a `1` and the machine resets, returning to state `S0`. If the machine is in state `S2` and it sees a `0`, then the output remains `0` and the machine resets, returning to state `S0`.

Using the states and state transitions identified above, we can draw the FSM state diagram (@fig-three1s-fsm) with labeled states and labeled transition arcs.

### Truth Table
Using the FSM state diagram we drew above (@fig-three1s-fsm), we can now construct a truth table for our example circuit. To map our state diagram to the truth table, we use the bit patterns `00`, `01`, and `10`, for states `S0`, `S1`, and `S2`, respectively.

The left half of the table shows the present state (PS), also called the current state, and the input value. The right half of the table shows the resulting next state (NS) and output value. @tab-three1s-tt shows the truth table for our example sequence detecting circuit.

### Circuit
In the hardware implementation of a FSM, we assume that the state transitions are controlled by the clock. 

On each clock cycle, the machine:
1. Checks the inputs
2. Transitions to a new state
3. Produces a new output

In order to do these steps, we need a register (@fig-three1s-reg) to hold the current state of the machine. We assign a unique bit pattern, as in the truth table, for each of the states in the state diagram. The register can then keep track of which state the machine is currently in by holding the bit pattern corresponding to the particular state.

Next, we need to design a circuit that implements a function to map the input and present state to the next state and output, as outlined in the truth table in @tab-three1s-tt. We can use a combinational logic circuit (@fig-three1s-cl) since this circuit doesn't need to remember anything on its own.

Recall that input bits are applied to the FSM one per clock cycle. Therefore, we want to force a state transition on each clock cycle and can put the combinational logic block in a loop with the state register as shown in @fig-three1s-circuit.

:::

On each clock cycle, the combinational logic block looks at the present state and input value to produce the bit pattern for the next state and value of the output (`0` or `1`). On the rising edge of the clock, the new state value is captured by the register and the process starts again.

::::{note} What's inside the CL block?

CL blocks contain the combinational logic needed to implement the circuit's truth table. In most cases, we use a collection of logic gates to implement any CL function. In CS 61C, we use these logic gates as the basic building blocks for our circuits!

The CL for this example sequence detector circuit is shown in @fig-three1s-cl-gates.

See [Logic Gates](#sec-logic-gates) and [Boolean Algebra](#sec-boolean-algebra) for more details on the common gates and how to translate a truth table into combinational logic!
