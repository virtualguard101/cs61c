## Learning Outcomes

* Use the stack pointer to push large amounts of data onto the stack.
* Translate array accesses in C code into assembly instructions.
* Identify one register convention by name: the stack pointer `sp` is register `x2`.

No video. We recommend pulling up the [memory section](#tab-rv32i-memory) of the [RISC-V Green Card](#sec-green-card).

## Local variables on the stack

So far, we have been able to translate very tiny amounts of C code to fit into registers. If we have too many (data) words to fit into registers, we must use memory.

(sec-register-conventions)=
## Register Conventions and Register Names

As mentioned [earlier](#sec-register-names), a register can also be referred to by its **register name**. Register names define **convention**—that is, specifying how assembly instructions should use specific registers for specific common functions. These restrictions help build "agreement" upon how to translate separate components of a program so that the assembly instructions slot together.

:::{warning} The stack pointer `sp`

One such register name is the stack pointer `sp`, corresponding to register `x2`. Like in C, the RV32 memory model pushes and pops stack frames during program execution; each stack frame corresponds to data local to the current scope. All assembly instructions can use `sp` to access to the current stack frame and can push or pop data on and off the stack.

A **register convention** means that all assembly instructions should respect the convention. In an assembly instruction, writing `sp` is _equivalent_ to writing `x2`! It is therefore important that no rogue instructions use `x2` as, say, temporary storage and accidentally overwrite `sp`. Doing so may cause other instructions that use `sp` to inadvertently read and write memory at other addresses other than the stack!

:::

The RISC-V green card lists all [register names](#tab-calling-convention); we begin introducing and using them in this example.

## Problem Description

Translate the below C program by **only** using the temporary registers `t0`, `t1`, `t2`, and the stack pointer `sp` . You may access memory as needed.

(code-sp-example)=
```{code} c
:linenos:

int a = 5;
char b[] = "string"; // Array will get stored on stack
int c[10];
uint8_t d = b[3];
c[4] = a+d;
c[a] = 20;
```

(sec-sp-example-setup)=
## Setup

We will use temporary registers to store addresses, arithmetic data, and so on. We will store local variable on the stack by assigning each variable to some offset from our stack pointer `sp`.

The exact addresses of these local variables don't matter, so long as we're consistent. Suppose we use the following assignment:

| Variable | Address relative to stack pointer |
| :-- | :--: |
| `int a` | `0(sp)` |
| `char b[7]` | `4(sp)` | 
| `int c[10]` | `12(sp)` | 
| `uint8_t d` | `52(sp)` |

## Solution

Here is the full assembly translation of the [original C code](#code-sp-example):

(code-sp-example-rv)=
```{code} bash
:linenos:
li t0 5            # R[t0] = 5
sw t0 0(sp)        # store int a on stack
li t0 0x69727473   # load "stri"
sw t0 4(sp)        # store first part of string
li t1 0x0000676E   # load rest of string
sw t1 8(sp)        # store rest of string
lb t0 7(sp)        # 4(sp) from b, 3(sp) from [3] 
sb t0 52(sp)       # store into d
lw t0 0(sp)        # load a 
lbu t1 52(sp)      # load d
add t2 t0 t1       # R[t2] = a+d
sw t2 28(sp)       # 12(sp) from c, 16(sp) from [4] 
li t0 20           # R[t0] = 20
lw t1 0(sp)        # R[t1] = a
slli t1 t1 2       # 5*sizeof(int) = 5*4 = 5<<2
addi t1 t1 12      # t1 from [a], 12 from c  
add t1 t1 sp       # compute &c[a]
sw t0 0(t1)        # c[a] = 20
```

We discuss line-by-line translation below. For each section, try to use the image to interpret why we specified the corresponding assembly instructions. Then, check your reasoning.

### Line 2: `int a = 5;`

```{code} bash
:linenos:
li t0 5            # R[t0] = 5
sw t0 0(sp)        # store int a on stack
```

:class: dropdown

To initialize `int a = 5`, store a 4B word onto the stack. Because `sw` requires our word data to be in a register first, execute `li` (load immediate) and then `sw`.

:::

### Line 3: Initialize string `char b[] = "string";`

We would like to store the bytes of `"string"` onto our stack, starting at location `4(sp)`. There is a straightforward but tedious way to do so, and a concise way that requires a bit of cleverness.

One approach (straightforward but tedious):

```{code} bash
:linenos:
li t0 0x73
sb t0 4(sp)
li t0 0x74
sb t0 5(sp)
li t0 0x72
sb t0 6(sp)
li t0 0x69
sb t0 7(sp)
li t0 0x6E
sb t0 8(sp)
li t0 0x67
sb t0 9(sp)
sb x0 10(sp)
```

:alt: "Byte-by-byte string setup: repeated li and sb instructions place ASCII for string plus a null at 4(sp) through 10(sp); associated stack diagram highlights stored characters in red against garbage elsewhere."

Line 2 of [Stack Pointer Example](#code-sp-example).
:::

:::{note} Show Explanation
:class: dropdown
The char bytes of `"string"` are `{0x73, 0x74, 0x72, 0x69, 0x6E, 0x67, 0x00}` as per ASCII. Use `li` and `sb` repeatedly to store these bytes at addresses `4(sp)`, `5(sp)`, etc. Detail: We don't `li` for the null terminator and instead directly store `x0`, the hardwired `0`, for the null terminator `'\0'`  (which has ASCII value `0x00`).
:::

Alternate approach with much fewer instructions:

```{code} bash
:linenos:
li t0 0x69727473   # load "stri"
sw t0 4(sp)        # store first part of string
li t1 0x0000676E   # load rest of string
sw t1 8(sp)        # store rest of string
```

:::{note} Show Explanation
:class: dropdown

We could cut the 13 load immediate/store byte instructions into 4 instructions: load immediate, store word.

This requires us to think about characters not as individual bytes, but rather groups of 4 characters. Remember, characters are stored as bits, and those bits can also represent integers. As long as we store the right 32-bit value into data, then those 32 bits can be interpreted as characters when we need it.

Second, note that words are stored as little endian. But character arrays should be stored in increasing address order. If we are representing every group of 4 characters as a 4B word, we will need to reverse the bytes such that the first character is stored at the earliest address, and the fourth character at the highest address. If we don't do this, our character string will not be stored properly in order.

* First 4B word: `{'s', 't', 'r', 'i'}` is `{0x73, 0x74, 0x72, 0x69}`. On this little endian architecture, we should store the 32-bit immediate `0x69727473`. Little endian means least significant byte is stored at the lowest address. `0x73` (`'s'`) is stored at `4(sp)`, `0x74` (`'t'`) at `5(sp)`, etc.

* Second 4B word: `{'n', 'g', '\0'}` is `{0x6E, 0x67, 0x00}`, i.e. just three bytes. But we need to make a 4-byte immediate, so a reasonable choice would be to sub in zero as the fourth byte. On this little endian architecture, we should store the 32-bit `0x0000676E` (where the "zero pad" is from my choice to insert a zero byte after the null terminator). Little endian means least significant byte is stored at the lowest address, so `sw t1 8(sp)` indicates `0x6E` (`'n'`) is stored at `8(sp)`, `0x67` (`'g'`) at `9(sp)`, `0x00` (`'\0'`) at `10(sp)`, and our dummy extra byte at `11(sp)`.

Two detailed questions raised in class a while ago:

* Why use `t0` and `t1`? Why not just `t0`? Yes, I could've done this (the original solution also minimized registers used). But I wanted to draw the two immediates stored to separate registers on the slide.

* `li` is a pseudoinstruction that generally resolves to `addi`. Doesn't `addi` only allow for 12b immediates, not the 32b immediates specified? Yes, you're totally right. `li` as a pseudoinstruction sometimes resolves to a pair of instructions, `lui`/`addi` , where the former is "load upper immediate." `lui` lets us load the upper 20 bits, and addi lets us load the lower 12 bits. More later; it turns out there is a complex signed addition note to consider :-)

No instructions needed.

:class: dropdown

We're not actually storing any data into memory, so no instructions need to be executed. At this time it's good to remember that our Setup was a design decision (that we, as the human compiler, made) that doesn't actually resolve to any instructions, either.
:::

### Line 4: Read array element `uint8_t d = b[3];`

```{code} bash
:linenos:
lb t0 7(sp)        # 4(sp) from b, 3(sp) from [3] 
sb t0 52(sp)       # store into d
```

:alt: "uint8_t d = b[3]: lb from 7(sp) loads byte 0x69 into t0, then sb writes that byte to 52(sp); memory highlights the indexed character and d’s low byte."

Line 4 of [Stack Pointer Example](#code-sp-example).
:::

:::{note} Show Explanation
:class: dropdown

This step practices how to do array indexing, thereby revealing the true reason why lb and sw use the base register + offset convention for addresses. Load `b[3]` (located at `(3 + (4 + R[sp]))`) and store byte to the location of `d` (located at `52 + R[sp]`).
:::

### Line 5: Store array element `c[4] = a + d;`

```{code} bash
:linenos:
lw t0 0(sp)        # load a 
lbu t1 52(sp)      # load d
add t2 t0 t1       # R[t2] = a+d
sw t2 28(sp)       # 12(sp) from c, 16(sp) from [4] 
```

:::

:::{note} Show Explanation

This step practices (1) more array indexing, and (2) how to add together two variables that were originally stored in memory.

1. In order to add two variables stored in memory, we need to load both variables from memory into registers (L9-10), then add them (L11).

2. The last line computes `&c[4]`. Since `c` starts at `12(sp)`, and `sizeof(int)` is `4`, `c[4]` is located 16 bytes from the start of `c`, or (12 + 16) = 28 bytes from `sp`.

### Line 6: Variable array indexing `c[a] = 20;`

This line is the most challenging of the bunch, so we recommend working it out via Venus once you learn how to use Venus in lab.

```{code} bash
:linenos:
li t0 20           # R[t0] = 20
lw t1 0(sp)        # R[t1] = a
slli t1 t1 2       # 5*sizeof(int) = 5*4 = 5<<2
addi t1 t1 12      # t1 from [a], 12 from c  
add t1 t1 sp       # compute &c[a]
sw t0 0(t1)        # c[a] = 20
```

:::{note} Show Explanation
:class: dropdown

This step is different from the previous one because we must compute the array address using another variable, `a`. So we can't just compute relative addressing. Instead, we must compute the absolute address in registers first, then store at that address.

* **Line 1.** Register `t0` contains the data we'd like to store, `20`.

* **Lines 2-5.** Compute our address `&c[a]`, which in bytes is `4*a + &c` (because `sizeof(int)` is `4`), which relative to the stack pointer is `4*a + 12 + sp`.

  * **Line 2.** Load in `a` to `t1`.

  * **Line 3.** Multiply `a` by `4`. This is equivalent to bitshifting left by 2. We haven't covered `slli` explicitly in lecture, but looking this up in our [refcard](#tab-rv32i-arithmetic) we see that `slli` is shift left logical immediate.`
  
    ```
    0x5 = 0b101     # a
    0b10100         # a << 2 
    = 20 = 0x14     # a << 2 in decimal, hex
    ```

  * **Line 4.** Add `12`. This is the offset of `c` with respect to `sp`.

    ```
    20 + 12 = 32   # in decimal
    = 0x20         # in hex 
    ```

  * **Line 5.** Add sp. This completes the address.

* **Line 6**: Store the desired data (register `t0`) at the desired address (register `t1` , with zero offset, because we've computed the absolute address already).
:::

## Quick Checks

:::{tip} Quick Check 1

Consider Line 18 from [the assembly translation](#code-sp-example-rv). As discussed in our explanation of [C line 6](#sec-sp-example-line-6), this is:

```bash
sw t0 0(t1)        # c[a] = 20
```

When this instruction is executed, what C expression is the closest representation of the value in register `t1`?

* **A.** `&c`
* **B.** `&a`
* **C.** `c[20]`
* **D.** `c[a]`
* **E.** `&c[a]`
* **F.** Something else

:::

:::{note} Show Answer
:class: dropdown

**E.** `&c[a]`. The value in register `t1` is defined (with Verilog syntax) as `R[t1]`; at this point, it is `(R[t1] * 4) + 12 + R[sp]`. The register value `R[t1]` is used as an address–it is the memory location to which we store the word `R[t0]`.

:::


:::{tip} Quick Check 2

Consider C Line 6 itself.

```c
c[a] = 20;
```

Why translate into the six lines discussed in our explanation of [C line 6](#sec-sp-example-line-6)? Why might a compiler NOT simply translate this C statement to a single `sw` instruction like `sw t0 20(sp)`?

`a` is a variable. Its value happens to be `5` at runtime, but compilers can’t necessarily simulate program runtime!
