## Learning Outcomes

* Practice loads and stores.
* Translate array accesses in C code into assembly instructions (see Long Example).

No video. We recommend pulling up the [memory section](#tab-rv32i-memory) of the [RISC-V Green Card](#sec-green-card).

## Example 1

Consider the assembly code:

(code-data-ex1)=
```
li x11 0x93F5 
sw x11 0(x5)
lb x12 1(x5)
```

Suppose that the memory layout starts as in @fig-rv-example-x12. After executing these instructions, what is in `x12`?

:alt: "Initial state: registers x5, x11, and x12 hold 0x100, 0xABCDEFAB, and 0xCDEFABCD beside a little-endian memory grid from 0x100 through 0x10C with associated byte values."

Starting memory layout for [Example 1](#code-data-ex1).

_Hint_: See the section on [pseudoinstructions](#sec-pseudoinstructions) like `li`.

`R[x12]` is `0xFFFF FF93`.

Load Immediate (`li rd imm`) is `addi rd x0 0x93F5`. The pseudoinstruction therefore maps to `addi x11 x0 0x93F5`, so set `R[x11]` (the value of register `x11`) to the bits `0x000093F5`.

:alt: "After load immediate: x11 updates to 0x000093F5 while x5 and x12 are unchanged and memory still shows the original byte grid."

Compute memory address as base register + offset, or `R[x5] + 0` = `0x100 + 0` = `0x100`. Store `R[x11]` (the value of `x11`) to memory at address `0x100`. On this (assumed) little endian architecture, `0xF5` gets stored at the lowest byte `0x100`.

:label: fig-rv-example-x12-sol2
:width: 100%
:alt: "After store word: the word at 0x100 is highlighted in green as 0x000093F5 in little-endian, matching the updated value of x11, with other addresses of memory unchanged."

Solution (2/3) for [Example 1](#code-data-ex1).
:::

::::

::::{note} Explain `lb x12 1(x5)`
:class: dropdown

Compute memory address as base register + offset, or `R[x5] + 1` = `0x100 + 1` = `0x101`. Load byte `0x93` from memory at address `0x101` into the lowest byte of register `x11`.

`lb` means we must sign-extend. The top bit of 0x93 is 1, so fill top 24 bits with `1`s:

```
0x93 = 0b1001 0011
--> 0b1…1 1001 0011
--> 0xFFFF FF93
```

:::{figure} images/examplex12-sol3.png
:label: fig-rv-example-x12-sol3
:width: 100%
:alt: "After load byte: byte 0x93 at offset plus one from 0x100 is highlighted and x12 holds an updated sign-extended value 0xFFFFFF93 while x5 and x11 retain prior values."

Solution (3/3) for [Example 1](#code-data-ex1).

**Solution**: `R[x11]` (the value in `x11`) is `0xFFFFFF93`.

### Example 2

Suppose that `x` and `y` are `int *` pointers whose values are in registers `x3` and `x5`.

How do we translate the statement `*x = *y;` into assembly?

Consider the following instructions:

1. add x3 x5 zero
2. add x5 x3 zero
3. lw x3 0(x5)
4. lw x5 0(x3)
5. lw x8 0(x5)
6. sw x8 0(x3)
7. lw x5 0(x8)
8. sw x3 0(x8)

And consider the following choices:

* A. 1
* B. 2
* C. 3
* D. 4
* E. 5 → 6
* F. 6 -> 5
* G. 7 → 8
* H. Something else

We leave the solution to you, for now!
