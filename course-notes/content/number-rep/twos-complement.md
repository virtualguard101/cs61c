## Two's Complement

Ones' complement:
* Problem: Negative mappings “overlap” with the positive ones, creating the two 0s.
* The solution: **Shift the negative mappings left by one.**

Two gold arrows point to the right across the entire scale, indicating that adding to the binary value consistently increases the numerical value across both negative and positive ranges."

"Binary odometer" for 4-bit twos' complement.
:::

Of note:
* Like in ones' complement, incrementing the binary odometer corresponds with integer addition by one.
* `0b0000` is still $0$.
* Positive numbers are the same as ones' complement.
* Negative numbers are shifted over! For example, `0b1111` now maps to $-1$. This gives us one extra negative number.
* The most significant bit (leftmost bit) can still be interpreted as the **sign bit**.

> In Two's Complement, a bit pattern of all ones is $-1$.

:::{tip} Quick Check

Suppose you use $N$ bits to represent integers with two's complement. How many positive numbers? negative numbers? zero?

* Zero: 1
* Positive: $2^{N-1} - 1$
* Negative: $2^{n-1}$

## Arithmetic and conversion

Hardware for two's complement is now simple.

> Addition is exactly the same as with an unsigned number.

The numbers $5$ and $-5$ are represented in 4-bit two's complement with `0b0101` and `0b1011`, respectively. Adding them together should result in $0$, or `0b0000`.

:alt: "A diagram compares the decimal addition of positive and negative five with the equivalent operation in two's complement binary, adding 0101 and 1011. The binary calculation displays red carry bits and results in a five-bit sum where the leading bit is discarded to achieve the correct four-bit value of 0000, which is the number zero."

Addition in two's complement follows the decimal intuition.

:::{note} Explanation
:class: dropdown

Work right-to-left:

1. `1+1=0` carry `1`
1. `1+0+1=0` carry `1`
1. `1+1+0=0` carry `1`
1. `1+0+1=0` carry `1`
1. `1` (is truncated and dropped in 4-bit representation)

(Double check that binary math matches decimal math: $5 + -5 = 0$)

## Formal definition

We can write the value of an $n$-digit two's complement number as

$$
- 2^{n-1} d_{n-1} + \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} 2^i d_i
$$

Positive and negative numbers can be computed using the same formula. Above, the sign is computed by multiplying the highest bit by $(-2^{N-1})$.

:::{card}
Example: $5$ and $-5$ in 4-bit two's complement
^^^

$$
\begin{align}
\texttt{0b1011}
&= (1 \times -2^3)  + (0 \times 2^2)  + (1 \times 2^1)  + (1 \times 2^0) \\
&=  -8    +  0          +  2            +  1 \\
&=  -5 \\
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\texttt{0b0101}
&= (0 \times -2^3)  + (1 \times 2^2)  + (0 \times 2^1)  + (1 \times 2^0) \\
&=  0           +  4            +  0            +  1 \\
&=  5 \\
\end{align}
$$

<!--TODO: there is a pedagogically simpler way to think about this. We discuss later (as in, copy over the formula from precheck summary).-->

## Two’s Complement: Flip sign

Hardware to convert positive to negative (& vice versa) is simple.

1. Complement all bits
1. Then add 1

:alt: "Two procedures illustrate the two's complement sign-change process by converting positive five to negative five and vice versa. Each example demonstrates flipping the bits of the starting binary value and then adding one to obtain the final result with the opposite sign."

Two's Complement: To change sign, flip the bits and add one.

At home: Prove algorithm is equivalent to formula!

The intuition comes from a "number wheel" representation of our binary odometer (Figure @fig-twos-complement-number-wheel). This wheel also helps us understand identify where integer overflow occurs:

:::{figure} images/twos-complement-number-wheel.png
:label: fig-twos-complement-number-wheel
:width: 100%
:align: center
:alt: "A horizontal number line and a circular number wheel visually represent the continuity and overflow points of 4-bit two's complement integers. Yellow warning triangles mark the critical boundary between the maximum positive value 0111 and the minimum negative value 1000 to indicate where arithmetic overflow occurs."

Top: A number line indicating where integer overflow occurs. Bottom: A number "wheel" indicating the same integer overflow location.
:::

In @fig-twos-complement-number-wheel, 0 through 7 stays the same as it has for every representation. But then it jumps to $-8$. That cool top-level term ($-8$) pulls all negative numbers down by **one** so there is no overlap at zero.


## Two’s Complement: C standard (as of 2025)

Two’s complement is the C23 standard number representation for signed integers. Again, the built-in `int` is ambiguous because it does not specify bitwidth. And again, the header `stdint.h` accommodates typedefs like `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t`, etc., for signed integer representations.
