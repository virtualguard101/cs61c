## And in Summary$\dots$

* We represent “things” in computers as particular bit patterns:
  * With $N$ bits, you can represent at most $2^N$ things.
* Today, we discussed five different encodings for integers:
  * Unsigned integers
  * Signed integers:
    * Sign-Magnitude
    * Ones’ Complement
    * Two’s Complement
  * Bias Encoding
* Computer architects make design decisions to make HW simple
  * Unsigned and Two’s complement are C standard. Learn them!!
* Integer overflow: The result of an arithmetic operation is outside the representable range of integers.
  * Numbers have infinite digits, but computers have finite precision. This can lead to arithmetic errors. More later!

Meta takeaway: We make design decisions to make the **hardware simple**. We threw out **sign magnitude** and **ones' complement** because the hardware would be hard. But here's a secret: it's the same hardware for mathematics on **unsigned and two's complement numbers**. The only difference is how you calculate overflow.

<!--For you to consider:
How could we represent -12.75?-->

1. What is a bit? How many bits are in a byte? Nibble?
:::

:::{solution} num-01
:label: num-01-sol
:class: dropdown

A bit is the smallest unit of digital information and it can be either 0 of 1. There are 4 bits in a nibble and 8 bits in a byte.

### Short Exercises

:::{exercise}
:label: num-05
1. **True/False**: Depending on the context, the same sequence of bits may represent different things.
:::

:::{solution} num-05
:label: num-05-sol
:class: dropdown
**True.** The same bits can be interpreted in many different ways with the exact same bits! The bits can represent anything from an unsigned number to a signed number or even, as we will cover later, a program. It is all dependent on its agreed upon interpretation.
:::

:::{exercise}
:label: num-06
2. **True/False**: If you interpret a $N$-bit Two's complement number as an unsigned number, negative numbers would be smaller than positive numbers.
:::

:::{solution} num-06
:label: num-06-sol
:class: dropdown
**False.** In Two’s Complement, the MSB is always 1 for a negative number. This means EVERY
negative number in Two’s Complement, when converted to unsigned, will be larger than the
positive numbers.
:::

:::{exercise}
:label: num-07
3. **True/False**: We can represent fractions and decimals in our given number representation formats (unsigned, biased, and Two’s Complement).
:::

:::{solution} num-07
:label: num-07-sol
:class: dropdown
**False.** Our current representation formats has a major limitation; we can only represent and do arithmetic with integers. To successfully represent fractional values as well as numbers with extremely high magnitude beyond our current boundaries, we need another representation format.
:::

:::{exercise}
:label: num-08
4. How many numbers can be represented by an unsigned, base-4, $n$-digit number.

    **A.** 1

    **B.** $2^n - 1$

    **C.** $4^n$

    **D.** $4^{n-1}$

    **E.** $4^n - 1$
:::

:::{solution} num-08
:label: num-08-sol

**C.**
:::

:label: num-09
5. How many bits are needed to represent decimal number 116 in binary?
:::

:::{solution} num-09
:label: num-09-sol
:class: dropdown
**7 bits**. $(116)_{10} =$ `0b111 0100` or $log{_2}{116} \approx 6.85$ which we round to 7 bits.
