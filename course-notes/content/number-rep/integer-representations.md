## Introduction

Historically, computers were used as scientific calculators. We therefore dedicate most of our time to understanding how a string of bits (a **bit string**) can represent a number.

> How can we use $N$ bits to represent a set of integers?

There are many systems we can use. Not all systems will help us represent $2^N$ unique integers in $N$ bits! We will focus on representing *signed* and *unsigned* integers.

* Signed integers refer to positive integers, negative integers, and zero.
* Unsigned integers refer to non-negative integers,  i.e., at least greater than zero.

## $N$-bit Unsigned Integer Representation

Let's get our standard unsigned integer representation out of the way first. The mathematical scheme discussed [earlier](#bin-dec-hex) is sufficient for representing $2^N$ **unsigned integers** with $N$ bits.

* `0b0...0` ($N$ zeros) represents zero
* `0b1...1` ($N$ ones) represents $2^N - 1$ (why?)
* Everything else: Assume the bitstring is the base-2 representation of a number. Convert.

This representation is supported in C (discussed more later). Built-in types like `unsigned int` can introduce ambiguity because it doesn't specify the width of an `int`. The header `inttypes.h` accommodates typedefs like `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, etc. to specify unsigned integer representations that are 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit etc.

:::{caution} How many bits do we need for a system that supports $10 + 7$?

* 10 in binary is `1010`. 4 bits.
* 7 in binary is `0111`. 4 bits.
* 17 in binary is `10001`. **5 bits**.

If we used a 4-bit unsigned integer representation, we wouldn't have enough room to represent the number 17. Instead, our "binary odometer" would truncate the result, cropping off the leftmost `1` and storing `0001`. So binary addition with 4-bit unsigned integers would imply that $10 + 7 = 1$...?!

This is the concept of **integer overflow** ([more later](#sec-integer-overflow)).
:::

## Design Considerations

We will prefer certain systems over others, depending on what sorts of integer operations we want to support.

### Common number operations

In decimal, we like to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and compare numbers. So we must be able to do the same thing with bit representations of numbers.

It turns out that many arithmetic operations translate reasonably well between decimal and binary.

For example, let’s add $10$ and $7$, which are `1010` and `0111`, respectively, in binary. The result is the number 17, or `10001` in binary. 

$$
\begin{array}{rrl}
  & \texttt{ 11  } & \text{carry bits} \\
  & \texttt{ 1010} \\
+ & \texttt{ 0111} \\
\hline
  & \texttt{10001} &
\end{array}
$$

:::{note} Explanation
:class: dropdown

Work right-to-left:

1. `0+1=1`
1. `1+1=0` carry `1`
1. `1+0+1=0` carry `1`
1. `1+0+1=0` carry `1`
1. `1`

(Double check that binary math matches decimal math: $10 + 7 = 17$)
:::

Subtraction in binary works similarly. We leave an in-depth discussion of implementing binary comparison (e.g., $X < Y$) to a future project.


### The Odometer Analogy

In theory, numbers have an infinite number of digits (usually leading zeros), but in computing, we must allocate a _finite_ number of bits. Hardware is limited! Binary bit patterns are therefore **abstractions**: they are simply representatives of numbers. 

In choosing an integer representation, we must consider whether the operations supported will still work within the given **bit width** of an integer representation. One useful analogy for considering edge cases comes from the idea of an odometer:

:::{figure} images/odometer.jpg
:label: fig-odometer
:alt: "Close-up photograph of a mechanical car odometer showing the reading 999999 just before it rolls over. The image illustrates a finite counting device that will wrap back to 000000 after one more tick."
:width: 70%

A car odometer measures mileage. It starts at 0 and slowly ticks up, then wraps around again. At some point, the odometer above will hit 999999; the next number is again 0.
:::

Two sets of values to consider:

* The binary values `000...000`, `000...001`, `000...010`, ..., `111...111`
* Integers incrementing by one, as placed on a number line

As we will see, there are systems in which the "directions" of these values may diverge.

(sec-integer-overflow)=
### Integer Overflow

> *Integer overflow*: The arithmetic result is outside the representable range of integers.

Suppose we use $N$ bits to represent integers in hardware. If the result of an integer operation ($+, -, \times, \div, <, =, \leq$, etc.) cannot be accurately represented in $N$ bits, we say that *integer overflow* occurred.

:::{figure} images/overflow.png
:label: fig-overflow
:alt: "A blue horizontal line marked with 4-bit binary values from 0000 to 1111 illustrates a finite number system. An gold curved line connects the maximum value back to the minimum value to visually represent the concept of arithmetic overflow in digital systems."
:align: center

With unsigned integers, the "binary odometer" wraps around.
:::

4-bit unsigned integers: Using 4 bits, you can represent 0 through 15.

* *Positive Overflow*: If you are at 15 (`0b1111`) and add 1, the value wraps around to 0 (`0b0000`).
* *Negative Overflow*: If you are at 0 (`0b0000`) and subtract 1, it wraps around to 15 (`0b1111`).

:::{caution} There is no such thing as integer underflow

People often mistakenly call negative overflow "underflow," but underflow is a different concept we will discuss later when we consider representing fractions.
:::

### $N$-bit Signed Integer Representations

How do you represent negative numbers? More generally, how do you represent _both_ positive _and_ negative numbers (and _zero_) with the same $N$ bits?

Sidebar: There was a king who asked his wise thinkers to teach him economics. They kept bringing him long books, and he kept sending them away to make it shorter. Finally, they came back and said, "Sire, we have the theory of economics in four words: '[Ain’t No Free Lunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch).' " It means you can't get something for nothing.

If we want to represent *negative numbers*, you’ve got to give something up; you lose some of the positive numbers you used to have. If we borrow a bit, we can't go as high in the positive range, but now we can do negatives.

Next, we discuss a few reasonable ones and consider tradeoffs. In the [next section](#sec-twos-complement), we'll reveal the standard representation used in modern architectures and supported by the C23 standard.

## Sign-Magnitude

> * Leftmost **sign bit**: the integer's **sign**. `0` is positive; `1` is negative.
> * Rest of bits: **magnitude** of the integer in binary

:::{card}
4-bit Sign-Magnitude
^^^

* Positive numbers: $1$ (`0b0001`) to $7$ (`0b0111`)
* Negative numbers: $-1$ (`0b1001`) to $-7$ (`0b1111`)
* Two zeros: $+0$ (`0b0000`) and $-0$ (`0b1000`)

:::

We already see one problem! With a positive and a negative zero, we'd have to check for two different patterns in code, every time we want to compare values to zero.

:::{figure} images/sign-magnitude-two-zeros.png
:label: fig-sign-magnitude-two-zeros
:width: 50%
:alt: "Two equations display the hexadecimal values 0x00000000 and 0x80000000 equating to positive and negative zero, respectively. Curved lines map the hexadecimal digits to a binary expansion, illustrating that the leading bit determines the sign while the remaining bits represent the magnitude of zero."
:align: center
Sign-Magnitude has two representations for zero: "positive zero" and "negative zero.
:::

Let's examine a subtler problem, revealed via the binary odometer:

:::{figure} images/sign-magnitude-number-line.png
:label: fig-sign-magnitude-number-line
:width: 100%
:alt: "A blue horizontal number line displays 4-bit binary values to illustrate sign-magnitude representation, with 0000 at the center. Two gold arrows point in opposite directions from the center to indicate how values increase in magnitude for both positive and negative binary sequences."
:align: center

"Binary odometer" for 4-bit sign-magnitude.

:::

The problem with Sign and Magnitude is that as the odometer goes up, it goes the wrong way: you go positive, positive, and then suddenly you hit the negative range. Incrementing the binary odometer `0000` to `1111` starts at $0$, then $1$, through to $7$, then wraps to $0$ again, then $-1$, then $-7$. In other words, sometimes integer addition corresponds to adding bits, and sometimes integer addition corresponds to subtracting bits. This would get complicated very quickly!

:::{note} Further Explanation
:class: Dropdown

Consider adding $5+(-5)$ with 4-bit sign-magnitude integers.

* $+5$: `0101`
* $-5$: `1101`

If both numbers have the same sign, we keep the sign and peform addition on the magnitudes, accounting for overflow where needed. In this case, the numbers have different signs, so we would have to perform subtraction on the magnitudes. Arithmetic addition is conditional in this representation–it can either be binary addition or subtraction–and circuitry would be more complicated.
:::

Ultimately, Sign-Magnitude is considered a straw man[^strawman] approach for supporting general purpose computing with integers. Nevertheless, it has some reasonable applications in, say, signals processing, where users are more commonly looking to decouple sign from magnitude, much less add numbers together. Ask us for more.

[^strawman]: Wikipedia: [Straw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)

## Ones' Complement

> To represent a negative number, complement the bits of its positive representation.

Here, "complement" means that if the bit is `0` change it to `1`, and vice versa. Equivalently, to change the sign of a number, **flip** all bits of its binary representation.

Ones' complement: To change sign, flip the bits.
:::

1. Start with representing $+7$: `0b 0000 0111` (we add the spacing and the prefix for better visualization, but the actual bitstring is `00000111`)
1. Flip all bits: `0b 1111 1000` (again, actual bitstring is `11111000`) This is the representation of $-7$.

::::

We've fixed one problem. We still get integer overflow, sure, but at least incrementing the binary odometer now corresponds to integer addition by one in most places of the timeline.

Consider adding $5+(-5)$ with 4-bit one's complement integers.

* $+5$: `0101`
* $-5$: `1010`

Addition: `0101` + `1010` = `1111`, or $-0$. Arithmetic addition can be implemented with binary addition, regardless of operand sign.

Another added benefit of Ones' Complement
^^^
The leftmost bit (also known as **most significant bit**) is still effectively the **sign bit**.
:::

...But we still have the problem of two zeros.

Historically, this was used for a while, but eventually abandoned for [two's complement](#sec-twos-complement).

## Bias Encoding

**Bias Encoding**:

> * Keep track of a **bias**.
> * To interpret stored binary: Read the data as an unsigned integer, then **add** the bias
> * To store an integer as data: **Subtract** the bias, then store the resulting number as an unsigned integer.

Imagine you are recording an electrical signal wavering between 0 and 31 volts. Wouldn't it be cool to grab that graph and pull it down so it wiggles around zero? That's bias encoding.

We can shift to any arbitrary bias we want to suit our needs. To represent (nearly) as much negative numbers as positive, a **commonly-used bias** for $N$-bits is $-(2^{N-1} - 1)$.

:width: 50%
:align: center
:alt: "A diagram presents two parallel horizontal number lines. Vertical lines connect specific points on the top line to corresponding values on the bottom line to indicate the mapping between the two systems."

A bias-encoded representation effectively shifts the number line to an unsigned representation.

Example: $N = 5$ with bias $-(2^{N-1} - 1)$

* Bias: $-(2^{5-1} - 1) = -15$

:::

Here are some diagrams in case they are useful. @fig-bias-encoding-number-line represents a bias encoding where $N = 4$ and bias $ = -7$. The odometer just does the right thing; it counts up through zero with nothing strange happening.

You may also find the **number wheel** useful for seeing where overflow happens, and how integers increase with respect to binary incrementing. See @fig-bias-encoding-number-wheel.

We really like biased encoding for some specific applications we'll see later in the course.
