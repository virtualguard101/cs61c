## Learning Outcomes

* Translate between J-Type assembly instructions and machine instructions.
* Identify use cases for different unconditional jump instructions and pseudoinstructions: `j`, `jr`, `jal`, `jalr`, `ret`.
* Use J-Type instructions for conditional branches.

## Jump Instructions

:::{warning} This portion of notes are unwritten, but content is still in scope.

For this subsection, please refer to the [Spring 2026 lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18YSyN37XjHEjfkWigPHJWXNJB17AsSiAKW8f9XebE-8/edit?usp=sharing), section "Jump Instructions."

Additionally, see `jalr` covered in [I-Type](#sec-jalr-itype).

The remainder of this page covers in-scope content that was not covered in lecture.

## Conditionally Branching Far Away

Conditional Branches are typically used for if-else statements, for/while loops. In general, because these control structure are usually _pretty small_ (<50 lines of C code), we can use **B-Type instructions**. However, as we saw earlier, B-Type instructions have limited range: $\pm 2^{10}$ instructions from the current instruction (PC).

To jump even further, we can use **J-Type unconditional jumps** in combination with B-Type instructions.

:::{note} `beq x10 x10 far`

To branch to a far location, e.g., `beq x10 x10 far`, we can equivalently specify the assembly with one more instruction:

```{code}bash
    bne  x10 x0 next
    j far
next:
    # next instr
```
:::

Admittedly, J-Type instructions also have a limited range: $\pm 2^{18}$ instructions from the currrent insturction (PC).

If we wanted to jump to **any** address, RISC-V opts for jumping with [absolute addressing](#sec-absolute-addressing) and `jalr`. As discussed in a [previous section](#sec-jalr-itype), `jalr` is an I-Type instruction that sets PC to `PC = R[rs1] + imm`, where `imm` specifies a 12-bit immediate `imm`.

* To call functions with absolute addressing, instead of `jal ra Label`[^simultaneous]:

    ```{code} bash
    lui  ra <hi20bits*>
    jalr ra ra <lo12bits>
    ```

[^simultaneous]: The `jalr` instruction will save the jump address to the PC and save the current `PC + 4` to the `ra` in the same cycle (effectively, "simultaneously")

* To break out of loops using absolute addressing, instead of `j Label` (e.g., `jal x0 Label`):

    ```{code} bash
    auipc ra <hi20bits*>
    jalr  x0 ra <lo12bits>
    ```

See the discussion of [U-Type instructions](#sec-u-type) `lui` and `auipc`. Just like with resolving [`li` pseudoinstructions](#sec-li-lui), `jalr` sign-extends immediates. So if `lo12bits` has sign bit set, increment `hi20bits` by 1.

TODO: unconditional branch "definition" -- include this later when we discuss instruction formats

You might wonder if you can just make an unconditional branch using a conditional one, like beq x0, x0, label. While that would always jump, there is a catch: the range of a branch is shorter. Because RISC-V uses 32-bit instructions, we have to fit the instruction type, the registers being compared, and the label (an immediate value) into those 32 bits. A dedicated jump instruction doesn't need to specify registers to compare, so its immediate value can be larger, allowing it to reach farther in the program.
