:::

::::

Recall that [I-Type](#sec-i-type) arithmetic instructions encode an sign extension 12-bit immediate as a two's complement integer, which is then sign-extended to a 32-bit value. While constants are frequently short and fit into the 12-bit I-Type fields, we inevitably need to encode **wide immediates** to build numberic constants larger than the I-type's 12-bit `imm`.

RISC-V achieves wide immediates as follows:

* Specify 32-bit constants using **two instructions**: an I-Type arithmetic instruction for the 12-bit **lower immediate**, i.e., bits 0 to 11; and and a different instruction for the 20-bit **upper immediate**, i.e., bits 12 to 31. (Again, **reduced** instruction set!)
* Define an instruction format, **U-Type** (the "U" is for Upper immediate), that can be used for instructions that specify upper immediates.

There are two U-Type instructions: `lui` and `auipc`. These are located in the "Other" section of the [RISC-V green card](#tab-rv32i-other).

## Load Upper Immediate (`lui`)

From the P&H textbook (Chapter 2.10), one such instruction, `lui`, is **L**oad **U**pper **I**mmediate:

> ...load a 20-bit constant into bits 12 through 31 of a register. The rightmost 12 bits are filled with zeros.

In @tab-lui, we call this upper immediate `immu` and the 32-bit immediate `imm`.

:::{table} The `lui` instruction.
:label: tab-lui
:align: center

| Instruction | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `lui rd immu` | Load Upper Immediate | `imm = immu << 12`<br/>`R[rd] = imm` |
:::

As shown in @fig-u-type-immu, `imm = immu << 12`; this 32-bit numeric constant `imm` is then written to register `rd`.

:alt: "32-bit U-Type instruction format: the 20-bit field immu sits in bits 31–12, bits 11–0 are zero, and the full immediate imm is formed by concatenating immu with twelve zero in the least significant bit positions."

For U-Type instructions, `immu` is the top 20 bits of a 32-bit-wide numeric constant `imm` `imm`.

### Load Immediate Pseudoinstruction

With this new instruction, we can now return to translating the `li` pseudoinstruction, Load Immediate. When we [introduced](#sec-pseudoinstructions) load immediate, you may have noticed a footnote in @tab-mv-li:

> This description is incomplete given the range of `imm` in `addi`. See the [green-card](@tab-rv32i-pseudoinstructions) and a [later section](#sec-li-lui) for the full translation of load immediates.

In other words, when `li` must use a numeric constant wider than the 12 bits accommodated by the I-Type `addi`'s `imm` field it translates to **two** instructions: `lui` and `addi`.

| Pseudoinstruction | Name | Description | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `li rd imm` | Load Immediate | `R[rd] = imm` | `lui` (if needed), `addi` |

In other words, `li` translates to `addi` when the immediate is between -2048 and 2047. For anything larger, `li` translates to **two** instructions: `lui` and `addi`.

In general, the compiler or assembler will break large constants across the `lui` and `addi` instructions, as needed. After all, there are some important **caveats** to this process. Hover over the two footnotes below before continuing.

* `lui` to set the upper 20 bits[^lui-caveat]
* `addi` to "set" the lower 12 bits[^addi-caveat]

[^lui-caveat]: And zero out lower 12 bits
[^addi-caveat]: "Set" as in, add a **sign-extended** 12-bit immediate

:::{warning} Translating `li` to real instructions

`addi` extends the sign of its 12-bit immediate. See Example 2 below. Be careful!
:::

:::{tip} Example 1
Translate `li x10 0x87654321` to real instructions.

Solution:

```bash
lui  x10 0x87654
addi x10 x10 0x321
```

:::

:::{note} Show Explanation
:class: dropdown

1. `lui` sets `x10` to `0x87654000`. Note `0x87654` is 20 bits.
2. `addi` sets `x10` to `0x87654321 = 0x87654000 + 0x00000321`, where the latter operand is the sign-extended version of the 12-bit immediate `0x321`.

:::

:::{tip} Example 2: Edge Case
Translate `li x10 0xB0BACAFE` to real instructions.

Does not work:

```bash
lui  x10 0xB0BAC
addi x10 x10 0xAFE
```

Solution:

```bash
lui  x10 0xB0BAD
addi x10 x10 0xAFE
```

Let's first consider the strawman[^strawman], which **does not work**:

[^strawman]: Wikipedia: [Straw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)

```bash
lui  x10 0xB0BAC
addi x10 x10 0xAFE
```

Remember, the `addi` instruction **sign-extends** the 12-bit immediate `imm`. If the sign bit of `imm` is set, then `imm` is negative, **subtracting 1** from the upper 20 bits set by the previous `lui` instruction.

1. `lui` sets `x10` to `0xB0BAC000`.
2. `addi` sets `x10` to `0xB0BAC000 + 0xFFFFAFE`, because the 12-bit immediate `0xAFE` is a two's complement negative number. `x10` is then set to `0xB0BABAFE`.

@fig-li-lui-strawman "cutely"[^pain] illustrates this "subtraction by one" using hexadecimal arithmetic and algebraic properties.

[^pain]: For some definition of "cute"; here, "cool math"

:::{figure} images/li-lui-strawman.png
:label: fig-li-lui-strawman
:width: 40%
:alt: "Arithmetic example showing the addition of hexadecimal value 0xB0BAC000 with 0xFFFFFAFE to produce the resulting 0xB0BABAFE word. The arithmetic is separated into an addition of the least significant three nibbles with three 0s, and the most significant 5 nibbles added to -1, represented with five hexadecimal Fs."

When `addi`'s immediate `imm` is signed, a naive `lui` immediate `immu` will yield an incorrect numeric constant.
:::

To solve this, know that `addi` will always follow `lui` when resolving a `li` pseudoinstruction, and `addi` will always sign-extend its immediate `imm`. So if `addi`'s 12-bit `imm` field is negative, **proactively add 1** to `lui`'s 20-bit `immu` field:

```bash
lui  x10 0xB0BAD
addi x10 x10 0xAFE
```

1. `lui` sets `x10` to `0xB0BAD000`.
2. `addi` sets `x10` to `0xB0BAD000 + 0xFFFFAFE`, because the 12-bit immediate `0xAFE` is a two's complement negative number. `x10` is then set to `0xB0BACAFE`.

## Add Upper Immediate to PC

Coming soon. Used for [J-Type instructions](#sec-j-type).

## U-Type: Fields

In order to translate `lui` and `auipc` to machine code, we need an instruction format that supports 20-bit immediates.
The U-Type instruction format is only used by `lui` and `auipc` and is the one of the last rows of the [instruction format table](#tab-rv32i-types) of the [RISC-V green card](#sec-green-card).

:::{figure} images/u-type.png
:label: fig-u-type
:width: 100%
:alt: "U-type instruction format layout with syntax opname rd immu and fields imm[31:12] (bits 31–12), rd (bits 11–7), and opcode (bits 6–0); additional notes specify that immu is the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit immediate produced by shifting that field left by 12."

The U-Type Instruction Format.
:::

U-Type has only three fields (@fig-u-type):

* **Register operand**: The U-Type field `rd` is the destination register to put the immediate.

* **Opcode**: The U-Type field `opcode` specifies the operation: `auipc` or `lui` (@tab-u-type).

* **Constant operand**: The **upper immediate field** (we'll call it `immu`) specifies a 20-bit immediate value. `immu` is **left-shifted** by 12 to form the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit numeric constant `imm` (@fig-u-type-immu).
