The average memory access time formula gives us a framework to present cache optimizations for improving cache performance:

:::

We can organize basic cache optimizations into how it impacts each of the three terms in this equation:

* Reducing the miss rate
* Reducing the miss penalty
* Reducing the hit time

The cache optimization techniques in this chapter improve performance in one of the above categories, but often come at the cost of hurting other categories. @tab-cache-optimizations summaries the complexity and performance benefits.

:::{table} Adaptation of Figure B.18 from _Computer Organization: A Quantitative Approach_. Summary of basic cache optimizations showing impact on cache performance and complexity. Generally a technique helps only one factor. (+) means the technique _improves_ the factor (_reduces_ miss rate, hit time, or miss penalty), (-) means it hurts that factor, and blank means it has no impact.

[^later]: Read about virtual memory. Coming soon.

We first note that of the [cache design policies](#sec-cache-design-policy), the [replacement policy](#sec-cache-replacement-policy) and [write policy](#sec-cache-write-policy) are not considered common cache optimizations. Rather, in practice caches are almost always designed with LRU (or FIFO) and write-back policies; the other alternatives are not considered reasonable. We thus focus our discussion in this section on other design principles and cache size/capacity.

## Larger Block Size

Larger blocks take advantage of spatial locality and so will reduce compulsory misses. At the same time, larger blocks may be costly for a few reasons, as shown in @fig-figurative-block-size:

* **Miss penalty**: With larger blocks, there is more to read from memory on a compulsory miss (and write to memory upon replacement). Larger blocks will increase the miss penalty.
* **Miss rate**: Initially, larger blocks will reduce miss rate because they improve **spatial locality**. Larger blocks reduce the number of blocks in the cache, so larger blocks may increase conflict misses and even capacity misses if the cache is small. Put another way, having fewer blocks can compromise **temporal locality** and (at some inflection point) increase the miss rate.
* **AMAT**: Because AMAT incorporates both of these components, increasing the block size past a certain point can _increase_ AMAT.

:alt: "Three conceptual trend graphs compare miss penalty, miss rate, and AMAT versus block size. The miss-penalty graph rises with block size, the miss-rate graph decreases at first and then increases for larger blocks, and the AMAT graph decreases initially before rising again."

While larger blocks can initially reduce miss rate because they improve spatial locality, they also reduce the number of blocks in the cache and can compromise temporal locality. Past a certain point, average memory access time will increase with larger block size.

@fig-data-block-size shows the miss rate tradeoff in more detail, as measured on an early 2000s benchmark.

:::{figure} images/data-block-size.png
:label: fig-data-block-size
:alt: "Empirical miss-rate versus block-size plot for multiple cache sizes. The plot compares 1KB, 8KB, 16KB, 64KB, and 256KB caches. Each trend line decreases as block size increases from 16 bytes to 64 bytes, but then increases as the block size increases further from 64 bytes to 256 bytes."

Miss rate versus block size for four different caches. Note that miss rate actually goes up if the block size is too large relative to the cache size. Adjusted version of Figure B.10 from _Computer Organization: A Quantitative Approach.

## Larger Cache Size

From _Computer Organization: A Quantitative Approach_, Appendix B.3:

> The obvious way to reduce capacity misses [in @fig-data-associativity] is to increase capacity of the cache. The obvious drawback is potentially longer hit time and higher cost and power. This technique has been especially popular in off-chip caches.

In @fig-data-associativity, we see that as cache size increases, miss rate decreases for all cache associativities.

As a modern example, the M1 chip has an L2 cache sized to 12 MiB—significantly larger than its L1 cache with 128 KiB.[^apple-m1]

## Higher Associativity

As discussed [earlier](#sec-cache-misses), higher associativity reduces the miss rate by reducing compulsory misses.

_Computer Organization: A Quantitative Approach_ measures miss rate on caches of different sizes and different associativities, as shown in @fig-data-associativity. The direct-mapped cache (1-way set associative) has the highest miss rate across cache sizes.

:::{figure} images/data-associativity.png
:label: fig-data-associativity
:alt: "Total miss-rate versus cache size plot for varying cache associativities. All trend lines decrease in miss rate as cache size increases in KB."

Total miss rate for each size cache, by associativity. Note that together, compulsory misses and capacity misses (dashed lines) are by definition the miss rate of a fully associative cache. Adjusted version of Figure B.9 from _Computer Organization: A Quantitative Approach_.
:::

Also as discussed earlier, [fully associative caches](#sec-fully-associative) complicate hardware and can therefore increase hit time. Nevertheless, in modern processors, L1 caches have reasonable associativity, e.g., 4-way or 8-way.[^associativity] [^apple-m1]

[^associativity]: I don't have an exact source for this, but here are some snippets: _Computer Organization: A Quantitative Approach_ says, "In many recent processors, designers have opted for more associativity rather than larger caches" (Section 2.2). The section further mentions that the ARM Cortex-A8 (2005) uses four-way set associative caches.

[^apple-m1]: Yu et al. (SEC 2023) Table 1 reports that the Apple M1 chip P(erformance)-core has has an 8-way, 128-KiB (64B blocks, 256 sets) L1 data cache and 12-way, 12-MiB (128B blocks, 8192 sets) 16-way L2 caches. [presentation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/yu-jiyong), [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity23-yu-jiyong.pdf).

## Multilevel Caches

:::{note} Review our [AMAT section](#sec-amat)

In this previous section, we analyze how adding an L2 cache improves AMAT by reducing average miss penalty.
:::

We note that implementing multilevel caches costs hardware space (see an [earlier section](#sec-multi-level-caches) of the cache space on the [Apple A14 Bionic Chip](#fig-apple-a14). When we introduced [key cache terminology](#sec-cache-terminology), we also noted in a footnote that the Apple M1 chip has differently sized blocks for the L1 cache and L2 cache. This also complicates hardware. Nevertheless, multilevel caches are widely used in modern processors that handle a wide variety of applications.

## Other techniques

Other techniques certainly exist but are beyond the scope of this course–or at least, our coverage of the topic at present. Two additional techniques are addressed in _Computer Organization: A Quantitative Approach, B.3":

1. **Avoiding address translation when indexing the cache.** We discuss this later[^later] when we introduce virtual memory. This approach reduces hit time and is widely used.
2. (out of scope) Giving read misses priority over writes. If a read miss occurs that would also cause a memory write (i.e., a dirty block must be written back to the cache), implement a write buffer. This way, on a read miss, copy the dirty block to a write buffer, then read memory, _then_ write memory from the buffer.
