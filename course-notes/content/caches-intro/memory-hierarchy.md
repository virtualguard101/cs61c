## Memory Wall

While hardware performance has continued to improve, there is a persistent and increasing gap between the improvements in processor hardware and memory/device interconnects (the **Processor-DRAM gap**, or simply **memory gap**).[^att] The "**memory wall**"[^wulf-mckee] places a significant limit on performance for many modern workloads, especially in AI.[^arxiv]

By designing a **memory hierarchy**, we can leverage smaller amounts of high-speed hardware without ballooning the cost of our architecture nor sacrificing data and storage capacity.

(sec-memory-hierarchy-revisited)=
## The Memory Hierarchy, Revisited

Earlier, we assumed there were only **two** layers of our memory hierarchy: registers (on the CPU) and memory (DRAM is close, but on a separate chip). We now continue our [earlier discussion](#sec-memory-hierarchy-early) of memory hierarchy.

:::{embed} #fig-3-memory-hierarchy
:::

The mismatch between processor and memory speeds (the "careful tango" described [earlier](#sec-memory-hierarchy) leads us to add a new level: The **memory cache**, or cache for short. Caches are usually on the same chip as the CPU and fit into the memory hierarchy as follows:

* **Size**: Smaller than memory, but certainly larger than the 32 registers on our RISC-V processor.
* **Speed**: Use hardware that is much faster than DRAM (used for main memory), but slower than registers.
* **Cost**: Use hardware that is more expensive than DRAM.

There are additional levels lower than main memory: **disk** is a huge one (literally).

(sec-memory-hierarchy-copy)=
:::{hint} Layers of the memory hierarchy contain copies of data in lower levels
Just as the cache contains a **copy** of a subset of data in main memory, main memory contains **copies** of data on disk. We discuss later how layers "synchronize" these copies; different layers use different methods.
:::

+++ {"label": "block-hierarchy-management"}
Data moves differently between different levels of the memory hierarchy:

* **Registers and memory**: Managed by the compiler. Loads and stores move data in and out.
* **Cache and memory**: Managed by cache controller hardware. We will describe the high-level operation, but leave the implementation to a later course.
* **Memory and disk**: Managed by the operating system  and special hardware via [virtual memory](#sec-virtual-memory), a concept we discuss later. Additionally managed by the programer/user via files and file streams.
+++

To summarize, we aim for the illusion of a "very large and fast memory":

* We make memory **fast** by using a hierarchy, where higher levels use faster, smaller, and more expensive hardware and are located physically closer to the processor.
* We make memory **large** by leveraging the principle of **locality** by "caching" the "right" data in higher levels, and delegating lower levels to store more data. The lowest level contains all available data (though nowadays we don't go to magnetic disk and stop at SSD).

If useful, we revisit [Jim Gray's analogy](#sec-memory-hierarchy) of data access time on registers, on the cache, in main memory, and on disk.

(sec-multi-level-caches)=
## Multi-Level Caches

You may have noticed that the [memory hierarchy diagram](#fig-3-memory-hierarchy) contains multiple caches labeled Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.  A computer can have multiple caches, where each cache is a **copy** of data from lower in the memory hierarchy.

Consider Apple's A14 bionic chip, which we introduced [earlier](#sec-intro-sds):

:::{embed} #fig-apple-a14
:::

The L2 cache is located on the integrated circuit, often adjacent to the CPU. The System Level Cache labeled in the diagram is likely a Level 3 cache, shared across multiple CPU cores.[^system-level-cache]

[^system-level-cache]: We don't discuss L3 caches much in this course. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache).

:::{hint} IMEM and DMEM are caches!

The L1 cache is often embedded into two parts: **L1i** (instruction memory) and **L1d** (data memory). These are **precisely** the IMEM and DMEM blocks on our [RISC-V datapath](#sec-state-elements)!
:::

1. **L1 cache** (L1$[^cash-money]): Usually directly embedded on the CPU, hence why it is not labeled in the above diagram.  
    * Size: Tens or hundreds of [KiB](#sec-iec-prefixes).
    * Hit Time (see [cache terminology](#sec-cache-terminology)): Complete in one clock cycle or less.
    * Miss rate (see [cache terminology](#sec-cache-terminology)): 1-5%
2. **L2 cache** (L2$): Located on the integrated circuit, often adjacent to the CPU.
    * Size: Tens or hundreds of MiB.
    * Hit Time: Few clock cycles
    * Miss rate: 10-20%

[^cash-money]: The notation `$` for cache is a Berkeley innovation. Not me :-)

### Demo

To find out the sizes of different components of the memory hierarchy on a Linux-based machine, we can use `df` and `sysctl`. The following commands were run on a Mac OS X machine.

To determine **disk size**, use `df`. The default display is in blocks (e.g., lines); use the `-h` option for IEC prefixes (base-two), and the `-H` option for base-10 prefixes.

```bash
$ df -h
Filesystem        Size    Used   Avail Capacity iused ifree %iused  Mounted on
/dev/disk3s1s1   460Gi    17Gi    38Gi    31%    427k  395M    0%   /
devfs            215Ki   215Ki     0Bi   100%     744     0  100%   /dev
...
$ df -H 
Filesystem        Size    Used   Avail Capacity iused ifree %iused  Mounted on
/dev/disk3s1s1    494G     18G     40G    31%    427k  395M    0%   /
devfs             220k    220k      0B   100%     744     0  100%   /dev
...
```

To determine **cache size** and **memory size**, use `sysctl`. Because this command lists all attributes of the system kernel, we pipe the output through `grep` to get what we want. The default unit is bytes for memory and caches.

```bash
$ sysctl -a | grep hw.memsize
hw.memsize: 25769803776
hw.memsize_usable: 25143640064
$ sysctl -a | grep "hw.l.*size"
hw.l1icachesize: 131072
hw.l1dcachesize: 65536
hw.l2cachesize: 4194304
```

* **F.** 4 GiB

Written version coming soon, but not too soon. For now, know the following technologies:

* Caches use SRAM (static random access memory).
* Primary storage is memory. Technology used is DRAM (dynamic random access memory), often called RAM.
* Second storage is disk. Technology used is SSD (solid-state drive), though in the past magnetic disks (hard drives) were also common.
