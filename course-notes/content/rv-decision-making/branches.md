:title: "[CS61C FA20] Lecture 08.3 - RISC-V lw, sw, Decisions I: Decision Making"

Until 8:50
::::

In the past few chapters, we have learned how to use RISC-V as a calculator. We have learned [arithmetic](#sec-rv-arithmetic) and [bitwise](#sec-rv-bitwise) operations and [data transfers instructions](#sec-data-transfer) for accessing memory.
To support modern programming languages, however, we need to support **decision-making**–meaning, the computer should be able to _conditionally_ execute certain instructions based on the results of other instructions.

## Review: Control Flow

In C and higher-level languages, we specify decision-making with **control flow** syntax. Recall that in C, typically we execute statements sequentially. Control flow syntax creates structures that "jump" to other lines of code:

* `if` statements (and `if-else`, `if-else-elif`, etc.)
* `for` and `while` loops
* Function calls[^fn-call]

[^fn-call]: More later!

If we consider the processor as a central component, we **transfer** control to subsequent statements for their execution. Control flow can specify **conditional** or **unconditional** transfer to out-of-order statements. Consider the C code in @fig-c-control-flow:

:::{figure} images/c-control-flow.png

:alt: "Line-numbered C snippet with foo and main: green and black arrows from the if show conditional paths to the then body or past it otherwise, while blue arrows show unconditional call into foo and return to the line after the call."

Illustration of unconditional and conditional control flow transfer.
:::

The conditional `if` statement conditionally executes Line 4 only if `n > 5`; otherwise, it executes the next statement, on Line 6. By contrast, the call to `foo` in Line 11 unconditionally transfers control to the first statement in `foo` on Line 2; then, when `foo` returns on Line 6, control unconditionally transfers back to Line 12.

## Branches and Jumps

RISC-V implements control flow by changing the order of execution in the code. Specifically, such instructions **transfer control** by updating the [program counter](#sec-program-counter) not to the next instruction as is the default, but _another_ instruction. There are two types[^philosophy] of such instructions in RV32I: **unconditional jumps** and **conditional branches**.

[^philosophy]: If jumps are defined as unconditional, are there _conditional_ jumps? What about _unconditional_ branches? Both of these can probably be defined using the other, and you will see this overlap in terminology in lecture, in conversation, and in the literature. The [RISC-V ISA](https://docs.riscv.org/reference/isa/unpriv/rv32.html#2-6-control-transfer-instructions) is careful to refer to both "control transfer instructions" and, in almost all cases, associates the adjectives "unconditional" and "conditional" solely with "jump" and "branch," respectively.

**Unconditional jump**. Always set PC to a different instruction. We introduce the primary jump instruction here:

```bash
j Label
```

When run, this instruction will unconditionally **J**ump to the instruction labeled `Label`.

**Conditional branch**. Condition on the comparison of two register values. If the condition is met, set PC to a different instruction. Otherwise, the condition is not met, so set PC to the next instruction. The general format for branch instructions is `bxx rs1 rs2 Label`, where "`xx`" specifies the type of comparison to make.

(sec-labels)=
:::{hint} What are labels?
Labels are identifiers to specific lines of code (in C) or assembly instructions (in RISC-V). Labels do not themselves define a line of code, though they must have **unique names**. In assembly, labels are associated with specific instruction addresses. They are then used by the assembler to translate branch and jump instructions into their machine code counterparts.[^labels]

### Branch Example

How do we use branch instructions? Let's check out `beq` and `bne` in @tab-rv-beq-bne:

:::{table} Two RV32I conditional branch instructions.
:label: tab-rv-beq-bne
:align: center
| Instruction | `beq rs1 rs2 Label` | `bne rs1 rs2 Label` |
| :--: | :--- | :--- |
| Mnemonic | **B**ranch if **eq**ual | **B**ranch if **n**ot **e**ual |
| Comparison condition | Register values are equal:<br/>`R[rs1] == R[rs2]` | Register values are not equal:<br/>`R[rs1] != R[rs2]` |
| Condition is met | `PC = <addr of Label>` |  `PC = <addr of Label>` |
| Condition is not met | `PC = PC + 4` | `PC = PC + 4` |

:::

:::{hint} 
For readable, efficient RISC-V programs, you may need to **negate the branch** condition.
:::

Consider the two examples below, which assume the following mapping of C integer variables to registers:

```bash
x    y    z    i    j
x10  x11  x12  x13  x14
```

(sec-branch-ex1)=
:::{tip} Example 1

```{code} c
:linenos:
if (i == j) {
  x = y + z;
} else {
  x = y - z;
}
// …
```

Two reasonable translations of this code to RISC-V assembly are below and leverage two instruction labels, `If` and `End`.

```bash
# Choice A
       beq x13 x14 If
       sub x10 x11 x12
       j End
If:    add x10 x11 x12
End:   # …
```

Choice A uses `beq`. If `i` and `j` are equal, jump to the `If` label to execute the conditional `add` instruction. Otherwise, the processor naturally moves to the "else" condition, which is the `sub` instruction, after which it unconditionally jumps with `j End` to skip over the `If`-labeled instruction.

```bash
# Choice B
       bne x13 x14 Else
       add x10 x11 x12
       j End
Else:  sub x10 x11 x12
End:   # …
```

Choice B uses `bne` to _invert_ the inequality condition in Line 1 of the C code. If `i` and `j` are not equal, _skip_ the conditional `add` instruction, and go to the `Else` label to execute the `sub` instruction. If the branch is _not_ taken (`i` and `j` are equal), then the processor naturally moves into the next instruction—the `add`, which is exactly what we want–and unconditionally jumps with `j End` to skip over the `Else`-labeled instruction.
:::

(sec-branch-ex2)=
:::{tip} Example 2

```{code} c
:linenos:
if (i == j)	{
	x = y + z;
}
// …
```

```bash
# Choice A
       beq x13 x14 If
       j End
If:    add x10 x11 x12
End:   # …
```

```bash
# Choice B
       bne x13 x14 End
       add x10 x11 x12
End:   # …
```

Again, both choices are valid. Again, Choice B uses `bne` and more closely represents the original C structure. Choice B also produces fewer instructions and will be better for performance in the long run.

## Branch Instructions Summary

@tab-rv-branch lists the conditional branch instructions from the [RISC-V green card Control table](#tab-rv32i-control):

:::{table} RV32I conditional branch instructions.
:label: tab-rv-branch
:align: center

| Instruction | Name/Description |
|:--- |:---|
| `beq rs1 rs2 Label` | Branch if Equal |
| `bne rs1 rs2 Label` | Branch if Not Equal |
| `blt rs1 rs2 Label` | Branch if Less Than (signed) (rs1 < rs2) |
| `bge rs1 rs2 Label` | Branch if Greater or Equal (signed) (rs1 >= rs2) |
| `bltu rs1 rs2 Label` | Branch if Less Than (unsigned) |
| `bgeu rs1 rs2 Label` | Branch if Greater Than or Equal (unsigned) |
:::

This set[^mnemonic] is sufficient to describe the C comparators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for signed and unsigned integers. From the [RV32I Specification](https://docs.riscv.org/reference/isa/unpriv/rv32.html#2-6-2-conditional-branches):

[^mnemonic]: Here is Professor Bora Nikolic's tip for remembering which branch instructions are supported: "There exists a BLT sandwich (Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato), but I have never seen a BGT sandwich."

> Note, BGT, BGTU, BLE, and BLEU can be synthesized by reversing the operands to BLT, BLTU, BGE, and BGEU, respectively.

In other words, `bgt`, `bgtu`, `ble`, `bleu` are pseudoinstructions! We leave their translation as an exercise to you :-)

We have also discussed one jump **pseudo**instruction in @tab-rv-jump. We will explain this pseudoinstruction in more detail in a [future section](#sec-jumps).
